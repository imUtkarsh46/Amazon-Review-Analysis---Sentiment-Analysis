0,Madison Hatter,3.0,Generally gave higher blood oxygen readings then the other three units I tested,"  Of the four oximeters I tested multiple times, three generally gave the same readings while the SantaMedical oximeter generally gave readings 2-4 points higher than the other three.Interestingly, the LPOW model A340, the Amemo A310, and the Amemo A320E are all manufactured by Shenzhen Aeon Technology Co., Ltd, located in China.My top choice, the Amemo A320E gave the same readings as the oximeter my doctor used during my appt on 3 Nov 2020. My doctor also noted this oximeter fit my finger better than the other three.Please see my data spreadsheet attached as a photo."
1,Adam,5.0,Great for People with Asthma!,"  I am a 25-year-old male, I have asthma, and right now I am maybe 10-20 pounds overweight. I have relatively well-controlled asthma, however, sometimes if I get sick my asthma gets pretty bad. Given that we are in a global pandemic with a disease that is usually severe for people like me, I decided that even though my SPO2 levels sometimes dip below my typical 98-99% levels, it's very important to take your vitals daily, at specific times if you have a routine, in order to get a baseline for what is normal for you. This is a better indicator of whether or not you are sick with either a respiratory disease and/or your asthma/other respiratory condition is worse one-day-verses another. This partcicular SPO2 metering device was priced well & is very accurate. Some of my complaints are that it is made in a way that contributes to climate change and environmental pollution. This pollution is the very reason for not only destroying our planet, but why people like myself develop asthma in the first place. However, despite this, this product is worth the money and my health is very important.This may seem boring, but, I hope this was helpful."
2,Tom T,5.0,Simple. Does what it should,"  Purchased this O2 monitor while recovering from pneumonia. It arrived quickly and I found it very simple to use. Readings came up quickly (much sooner than the 30 seconds noted). Reading are consistent and don't seem to vary around more than 1%. Operation is very simple. Put it on a finger, relax the finger, press the button.The readout is large and bright so I can read it without glasses. I examined the O2 sensor used at my doctor's office and it appears to be the same unit I'm using. good enough for me.I recommend."
3,DAG,1.0,Check accuracy with healthcare provider's equipment.,"  I purchased 2 different brands, compared to known accurate oximeter, both do not correlate.  Maybe I just unlucky twice.  But  I strongly suggest any purchased be compared to those of known healthcare provider who has accurate equipment.Update:  So I took it on a walk today to give it a 2nd chance.  The battery cover fell off in my pocket.  It at times correlated with my known accurate meter, but that did not last long.  The picture is another example.  Note it does correlate fairly well on the heart rate.  As a doctor concerned about respiratory status of ill patients using these at home, I strongly suggest all oximeters should be correlated with those of healthcare providers.Update#2  Santamedical offered to send me a replacement - will update when new unit checked."
4,CGV,1.0,Ordered two Pulse Ox Meters.....the seals of each of the boxes were broken,"  I really wanted to like this product.  However, upon receiving delivery, the boxes for the two meters I received were apparently opened in that  the plastic seal on each box were broken.  I did not want to send back the meters in that I needed the meters to monitor oxygen levels in light of teh COVID pandemic......."
5,Six One Six,1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!,  Product worked one time after I received it. Display will not come on most of the time and when it does it looks like this. Returning for a refund.
6,Woodchuck,2.0,Just OK,"  This Pulse Oximeter has me scratching my head, because I don't think it is very accurate.  I found that the heart-rate monitor is totally unreliable, especially after exercise.  That makes me question the O2 accuracy as well.Just today, after a bike ride, mine jumped around from 188 bpm, down to 49 bmp, up to 163 bpm, and then down to 115 bpm over a 3 min period.  I resorted to a blood pressure monitor to calculate my heart rate, which was actually 89 bpm."
7,MARIA,1.0,Don't buy this product!!!!,"  Does NOT work at all!!!!I thought battery problem so check many times but NO... Does not work at all, it does not even emit lights on, disgusting!!;You don't have to be a genius to operate this, and I happen to be a nurse so figure it out!!"
8,DG Global,5.0,Great buy!,"  Love this pulse oximeter. This is my 2nd purchase. Ordered this before, before the pandemic, for my emergency kit for our home and for the reason that me and my son has asthma we wanna make sure that our SPO2 is within the normal range and i order again to bring with me in my purse all the time. Accurate I must say. And is very convenient, compact, portable and easy to use. Just throw in your purse, it's safe since it comes with pouch and lanyard. This will be a great gift for medical workers or just for personal use. I will definitely recommend this."
9,Papa Will,5.0,Works exactly as expected,"  Having a bad cough, I was tested for COVID and the flu, but both came back negative but there was concern over my blood oxygen level at 93%. I got my prescription and ordered this all in the same day. After starting the antibiotic, my levels were back up to 99% but have seen them drop immediately after a coughing fit. The price was good and the ratings were high, and I would agree with the ratings. Five stars. Nice to have a reference level that I can trust."
10,Melissa,5.0,Easy to Read and Operate,"  This monitor arrives securely packaged with a set of batteries, lanyard and convenient storage pouch that has a secure but easy to open velcro flap.  The device has an easy slide battery compartment making the batteries easy to install. It is user friendly but this one did not come with any information regarding the normal ranges for the readings.  That is easily solved with a quick Google search but it would have been nice to include a printout.  It is easy to open, not too fussy about finger placement and easy to read.  Turning it off did create some confusion for the person using it because it flashed Bye bye a bit too quickly to be noticeable so there were a couple of tries before feeling comfortable with that process."
11,Bull 30290,2.0,"Works but leaves a lot to be desired, not recommended","  I had a previous sensor that loved, but I lost it and it was no longer available on Amazon for a replacement so I bought these. Overall they seem to work but I'm not impressed...For reference: I bought two of these and my observations of both have been identical. The price point on my old unit and these was very similar.1. They are far more bulky than others I have has in the past.2. They are not as sturdy, and the hinge mechanism works but feels flimsy and doesn't stay aligned so I worry about it breaking soon.3. The battery compartment cover is barely held closed by the detent and comes off easily, somes even just bumping it. Worse, the battery compartment covers the entire back of the unit including the corner edges of the sides, so it is nearly impossibly to avoid and pops off all the time. It is also very difficult to remove the device from your finger without the battery door popping loose.4. The display area is much smaller than expected for the size of the unit. I later found my old unit and it has a slimmer design with a proportionally bigger display.5. The display is fixed in one orientation; it does not allow you to rotate it (e.g. for self-use vs for use on someone else).6. My older unit included settings and options for alarms, display settings, etc. These offer none of that (as far as I can tell).Overall they seem to work but I'm not impressed and am considering returning them. I recommend looking for a different model."
12,JanetE,1.0,"During this dangerous time, you need to have a reliable oximeter","  I'm in healthcare and I've used several oximeters. I do not think this one gives accurate readings. Usually the oxygen saturation will trend upwards. That's why you need to wait about 30 - 60 seconds.With this device, it's been 99 % every time. It never vacillates.I've used and given away around 10 oximeters. I've never seen one where the oxygen saturation never varies. If you want to return it, you need to call or text someone at amazon. The lady who assisted me said that my refund will be back on my card in 3 days. You cannot return it. I'll dispose of it once I see that my money has been returned to my card.During this dangerous time, you need to have a reliable oximeter. Stay away from this one."
13,Josef,3.0,Easy to use Oximeter,"  I like that the oximeter is easy to use and appears accurate. The only reason that I didn't give this oximeter  higher marks is because the plastic plate that covers the batteries comes off easily. At least on my unit, the plate could secure itself better. It has popped off on me several times, and I've had to use scotch tape to secure, otherwise I would have lost it. Other than this, the unit is functional and does the job!"
14,JudyBug,1.0,Item is NOT returnable although received damaged,"  I purchased this item based on its great reviews of accuracy. Unfortunately, the top flips off every time I use it, showing the inside of the top plate (motherboard and connector). It is my own fault that I failed to notice this seller does not allow returns, even if the merchandise is damaged. Because of its weight for accuracy, I cannot repair using glue or duct tape or chewing gum to fix the problem because the accuracy may be effected."
15,Jan,5.0,Easy to use and fast delivery,"  The order came in one day. Opened, inserted the battery and I was off and running.  The screen was very easy to read.  I did a quick Google search to see what PI (the bottom number on the screen) meant.  I cannot speak about the accuracy because I bought this device for home use.  I thought it would be good to add to my first aid kit in light of respiratory issues related to Covid-19.  Just an added tool to have on hand, God forbid, I should be infected.The quality looks good. The fact that it came with batteries and a case to protect it was an added convenience. I'm not sure if I'll need the lanyard but nice to have for the future I suppose."
16,JSS,2.0,Low quality,"  I regret buying this pulse oximeter but it's not worth my time to return it.  A number of red flags.  We had a decent unit that we gave to a relative when he contracted COVID-19, and figured we would just get another one for ourselves.  Since the local pharmacy where we got our previous one from was out of them, we ordered this one online.- Build quality of this unit is really cheap.  It wobbles and fits together poorly.  When putting it on your finger you have to avoid holding it a certain  way or the battery cover pops off.- It comes with a lanyard, as many of them do.  However, I DARE you to try to get it on.  The tiny holes to slip it through do not allow it to make the turn after getting it through the first hole, and both of us tried repeatedly and failed to get it done.  We're both capable people, and can thread a needle or even a fishhook, but not this.  It's no wonder why unlike our previous unit, this one comes shipped loose.- Not sure about the accuracy.  O2 level seems consistently a bit high +2% compared to all the others we have used (my wife is a nurse).  But close enough.- Distracting display with unnecessary clutter on the screen.- Tiny multi-language instruction manual, need magnification to read it, but it is what it is.Bottom line: It works, but feels and looks cheap.  We will likely give this one away and get a decent one elsewhere locally."
17,Dennis,5.0,Inexpensive well build digital OX & PULSE sampler,"  Bought to have on hand to check ox levels in event get sick. Assume its accurate but no way to know at this point as shows 98% saturation, my phone measures at 95% so for home usage, it is fine. My brother in law got an ox meter, got covid and his ox level was 84%. That single measurement put him in hospital on oxygen under active Dr. care and it was the concern that has now put him on mend. Disclaimer says not for medical usage but measuring  oxygen & pulse is same for exercise as sickness measurement. Thats why I bought it! Well built, has carry pouch, batteries and easy to use"
18,Rich P.,2.0,It started off Good and became unstable after 30 days,"  When I received this device it worked very well and very quickly for about two weeks.  After that time it started to take up to 60 seconds to recognize a finger and in fact often just turned off because it would not recognize the finger.  This happens even when I change fingers.  Further, many times when it finally does recognize a finger after about two to three minutes and after trying three to four different fingers it would give a reading of 85% or lower only to adjust up to 99% with another finger and then back to 99% when the first finger was used.  This problem has become more and more of a problem and I am only at 35 days.  I would return, but since it worked well at first I thought it would be good and am now outside the return window.  They said it came with a lifetime limited warranty, but cannot contact anyone and Amazon washed their hands when I sent them a note.  I would just say, Buyer beware if you plan on buying it and if you are good with a two to three week unit then you should be fine."
19,Dave Sparkman,5.0,works well,"  One of the first things that supposedly happens when you get covid, is that your oxygen levels fall.So, it's always nice to have one of these on hand. After checking reviews, I chose this one, and it has not been a disappointment. A couple of days ago I woke up being dizzy and nauseous. I checked my oxy levels, and they were 99 % . Turns out it was an impacted ear drum, and when I got it cleaned out I was a lot better.But it helps to have an assurance that it's not serious."
20,Micky,5.0,Decent and fast reading,  Been to Dr office multiple times and did side by side with theirs.  Was within 1 point. Very satisfied.  Almost instant reading.
21,Retired in Texas,5.0,Better Than Expected,"  The Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2) was delivered timely and well packaged.  Everything was included, with easy to understand instructions, except for the battery markings inside the actual oximeter were very hard to see.  It took me about 3 minutes and a magnifying glass to finally locate the positive and negative marks.  Also if you look at the instructions, the gold bands of the batteries are facing the same which would make you think the batteries go in the same direction, which they do not! They actually face opposite, as in most, but not all things.  That is my only comment to watch for.After getting the batteries inserted correctly, the unit powers up easily, is easy to read and seems very accurate. So I'm very happy with the purchase and recommend it!!"
22,Big Dog,1.0,Seems to not work with a pacemaker,"  I have a more expensive unit from another company and decided to get a lesser expensive SpO2 monitor for outdoor activity.When I got this, I tried it out sitting down at the kitchen table. O2 readings bounced from 90 to 99 percent and everything in between. About 10 seconds after it started reading the pulse rate flatlined and the unit shut off as if my finger wasn't in it (which it still was). Grabbed the more expensive unit to compare it to and tried again sitting down using both units simultaneously. No problem with the readings on the other unit, while the Santamedical unit flatlined again in less than 5 seconds after obtaining a reading. And in that short time the O2 readings varied from 88 to 97, bouncing up and down. Would not buy if you have a pacemaker as certain sensors don't work well with them (did some research on this), and that seems to be the case with this one."
23,Larry McGuire,5.0,Great Oximeter!,"  Easy to use, easy to understand, great value!"
24,ASOK,1.0,absolute junk,"  the plethora of positive reviews makes no sense for this modelthis model is extremely disappointing compared to the santamedical 6-panel display model ... this model is flimsy, ridiculously awkward to read because it can be read only vertically, and also has VERY tiny lettering. The vertical pulse graph along the side is also completely useless as it shows no difference between systolic and diastolic oxygenation.i'm going  back to the santamedical generation 2 with large bright letters, six display modes and a very useful oxygenation graphamazon.com/Santamedical-Generation-Fingertip-Saturation-Batteries/dp/B000ORVXPA"
25,Will F.,5.0,Works great and easy to use,  Ordered my own pulse oximeter so I would have it after discharge from hospital. One Respiratory therapist told me after I ordered it that most of the cheap ones only work for a couple weeks and in order to get a quality one I would need to spend twice as much. However when it arrived the director looked at the brand as I was taking it or of the box and told me that she had a couple of this brand and they last better than most others and she prefers the SantaMedical. After having many different ones on my finger in both the hospital and Rehab this one gives me a reading fast and accurate. I’m impressed that it comes with a one year warranty as well.
26,IJS,5.0,Great Product - Poor Delivery,"  The delivery report on Amazon said that the package with this product and one more product was left in the ""mail room"".  But, there is NO mailroom at the address the package was delivered.  The front door is open to this office building and the delivery address was to Suite 18; anyone can go right up to the door of Suite 18, but my cousin said that the package was left on the floor after opening up the main door to the building where anyone could take it.  The address on the package said ""Suite 18"", so why didn't the Amazon driver bring it to Suite 18?  Disappointed, but more than that, the driver lied when he/she reported that it was left in the ""mail room"" - as mentioned, there is no mail room..."
27,Joseph Shahoud,5.0,Good At What It Does,"  We recently ordered and received the SantaMedical fingertip pulseox meter. We love this thing. The display is very easy to read and, honestly, is beautiful. It fits very comfortably over the finger. One of the things I like most about this product is the literature it comes with. It explains exactly what is happening and how the meter works. It was quite educational, especially to an engineer like me. I also like the little carrying case and lanyard that it comes with. All well thought out. I highly recommend this PulseOx meter and believe that with the threat of Covid lingering around every corner, this is something you’ll want on hand before you get sick, not after."
28,Ventura Mort,4.0,Didn't like my fingernails!,"  This device worked beautifully with everyone else, but apparently my fingernails are very irregular in thickness and so it can't interpret the information it gets.  When I use it, it will show it's working, but for several minutes, it will show no results, and if it does they don't make sense (Oxy 85%, pulse 150, for example).  Then, after trying on several fingers, it may very quickly show an Oxy 96 % and pulse 62.  However, it's easy to use and read, and even shows the battery power level (very handy) .  Maybe in a few months, if my fingernails grow out smooth, It'll work for me.  If not for the problem, I'd give it 5 stars."
29,Gary B,3.0,It's OK but not great,"  I had intended to buy a meter that would send readings to my cell phone, but somehow I ended up ordering this one, which does NOT send readings to my cell phone. I've got two others, and this one is not superior to those -- reasonably accurate, but not so much as a larger cuff-style blood pressure meter would be, and the pulse rate monitor is sometimes sluggish, giving readings that would make me dial 911 if I didn't know the fault was with the machine, not with my heart. It's probably better than some, but certainly worse than others. Spend a little more and get a better one -- That's my recommendation."
30,Amanda Riley,5.0,Life Saving equipment,  I bought this product when I was admonished by my little sister and a friend to check my husband‘s oxygen levels because he grew very sick after a positive Covid test. This tiny device alerted us to the fact that he was experiencing hypoxemia. Thank God for this device! I took my husband to the ER where he was hospitalized for three weeks in the ICU. He was critically ill with Covid pneumonia. He needed oxygen immediately and he still on 24 hours seven days a week oxygen at home. Thank you for this!
31,Patricia Gordon,5.0,Reliable and Easy-to-Use,"  I needed a reliable pulse oximeter to track data for pre-existing health issues unrelated to COVID-19, so I did a fair amount of research before making this purchase. I’ve found it to be accurate and easy-to-use. It does seem to have issues getting a reading when my hands are cold, but all pulse oximeters have limitations, especially when circulation is reduced. This can be quickly resolved by warming up the hands and increasing blood flow. All-in-all, I trust this device and would both recommend and purchase again if/when needed."
32,Deb Hamerlinck,5.0,Accurate results at a good price point,"                    The media could not be loaded.
                




   I liked it it has a waveform so I can see the blood pulsating through my finger as it picks up a reading. I haven’t compared it to other oximeters but it seems to work quite well."
33,MP,1.0,Inaccurate and Inconsistent,"  Did not give accurate numbers and was rarely consistent.  Took several minutes to give a reading, and when it did, it would be different every single time no matter which finger I used.  First reading said my heart rate was 25bmp and my O2 was 80%, second said my heart rate was 31bmp and my O2 was 98%, and third reading said my heart rate was 90bmp and O2 was 88%.  I noticed the hinge was a little loose, so I tried pushing it down on my finger, but it didn't change anything.  I also switched the batteries out from the ones that came with no change."
34,Garett Hensley,5.0,A must have in my opinion,"  I want to say that this probe played a part in saving my life. I had Covid and was at home battling it. It was suggested I get a pulse oximetry device so I ordered this one. As soon as it arrived I put it on and it read 71%. Not thinking that was right I put it on my wife and daughter. They read 98%. As everyone in the house was sick with Covid we called 911. The monitor EMS was using read the same, 71%. Lets just say I got to the hospital in time or else it was going to be a bad Xmas. I appreciate that this item was so accurate and thats the reason I feel it played a part in saving my life."
35,skiimann,1.0,Slow readout and not particularly accurate,"  Thought I had lost my pulse oximeter that I bought at the start of the pandemic so I order this one just in case.  This one came promptly but the readout is very slow, and inaccurate at times.  I then found my original oximeter and compared the two.  This one often gives an inaccurate initial reading and then requires minutes to update to a more accurate and consistent reading.  last time I tried it, the oximeter eventually showed my resting pulse rate as 188 and O2 level of 88.  My original one accurately showed pulse of 65 and O2 of 98.  Several minutes later this one showed O2 of 98 but never updated my pulse.  Time to return it."
36,QueenReader,5.0,Perfect for us!,"  My son has heart issues and is currently on the list for a transplant. We use this frequently when he feels light headed to see if we need to go to the ER. It works great and is very accurate. One night our son woke us up to a racing heartbeat and this pulse ox was spot on with how fast it was going - too fast to be normal but not fast enough for our son's ICD to shock him. We went to the ER where they did actually have to shock him but without an accurate reading, we may have waited longer than was safe. Would recommend."
37,Just Me,3.0,Good Unit but Too Bulky and Unstable to stay on finger.  And there are better ones.,"  Pros:- Very bright screen- AccurateCons:- Does not stay on the finger easily if you move around at all, because:-- Too large and heavy-- Hinge is too loose (hinge must move a little to allow different sized fingers, but this one was too loose.I also bought this unit: Wellue 



   which has similar accuracy and bright screen, but also  stays on your finger well because it's lighter and has a tighter hinge.  Yes it's another Chinese-made unit, like they all are really, but just a better design.Note: I'm not a paid nor fake reviewer - I just like to research things well and let people know what I've found out.Background:I ordered three similar inexpecsive fingertip units from different companies to try and find a replacement for an expensive ($130-) Contec CMS50I wrist-worn unit that was very inaccurate and and had an unsably dim display.  I suspected that price might not reflect usability and I was right.  That pricey unit's primary benefits were connectivity via USB for data transfer."
38,ladyrider,2.0,Disappointed,"  While using this oximeter, during the time it is needed most, it will not show results, it just keeps running till it shuts itself off! I am so disappointed in this meter! Will a different one work better? I don't know! But we need this to work while the episode is happening! Sorry you can't put it on and just leave it all day!"
39,32 Win Spl,4.0,Accurate and Easy to Use,"  Great Sp02 meter for medkit or aviation use.  Seems accurate and less finicky about positioning or finger selection than my other meters.My only con with this meter, compared to my others, is it is slightly larger and bulkier, and it seems slightly less robustly constructed.  My other meters have rubberized material over the exterior plastic, which makes them seem like they could take a drop or 2 and survive.  That said, I feel this is a great value for anyone needing an Sp02 meter.  The larger size is probably necessary to accommodate the 2x AAA batteries, which is a plus on its own, since finding coin cells that last more than a week these days is problematic."
40,Gordon Jenkins,4.0,Helpful Device That Could Save A Life,"  This pulse oximeter is a tiny device that can tell you the oxygen saturation level in your bloodstream as well as your heart rate and strength of your pulse.  With the prevalence of Covid-19, knowing the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream can help you detect a potential problem before Covid-19 c would overwhelm your system. This advanced notice might even help to save your life. The only negative issue is that with everything being black, it was slightly difficult for me to attach the lanyard and insert the batteries properly. Also, the battery insertion instructions could have been a slight bit more detailed."
41,Edwin Kramer,5.0,Great value and easy to use,"  After a recent surgery, it was noted on discharge that oxygen levels were a bit low so they prescribed oxygen for a short period during recovery. Got the oxygen but didn't know if it was helping. You would think they would provide a pulse oximeter. Looked at Amazon and saw this one had a lot of reviews and people were happy. It was delivered within 12 hours and works as described and oxygen level are normal.Only thing I have as a negative is that the instructions give no description of what the measure values mean and what is considered normal. You can find the info online but would be nice to have it in the instructions or a link to a site. PI% is the one measurement that was a bit confusing but seems to give an indication on the reliability of the reading. The higher the percentage the better/"
42,Riverside E.,5.0,"Maybe it won't diagnose Covid, but it gives me peace of mind","  I've been rather concerned about catching Covid, since I live alone and have a few preexisting conditions.  Even with reasonable isolation, you still have to be around other people occasionally, unless you have a year's supply of food, gasoline and toilet paper.  I caught what I figured was a cold, but I didn't want to go to the doctor and catch Covid there if I didn't already have it.  Having read that low blood oxygen levels are a sign that you might have Covid that's causing lung issues, I ordered this little gadget.  It's super easy to use, well-designed and easy to read.  It let me know that my O2 levels were fine - maybe I had Covid and maybe I didn't, but I got better and didn't unnecessarily get more exposure running to the doctor.  (Note:  I am obviously not a doctor, so please don't take this as medical advice!)"
43,Richard Embry,4.0,"Generally good, but the readings can be erratic...","  I like this in so many ways.  It's compact, easy to use, and it provides the necessary readings. However, I notice that sometimes the readings will jump around if I leave the device on my finger for, say, 15-30 seconds.  The oxygen reading can sometimes vary between 96-99 over 30 seconds, which doesn't seem to make much sense.  Do I like this?  Yes.  Do I think it's accurate?  Reasonably accurate - I feel it at least provides me pretty close readings, which I can accept."
44,Doak Procter,5.0,Very Compact and Easy to Read--A Nice Comfort,"  We picked this up after some suspected COVID exposures.  It appears to be rather accurate as best as I can tell (by comparing the measurements to the pulse oximeter I have on my watch).  It's very compact and couldn't be easier to use.  It was nice to have around, now that the whole house has gone through covid.The numbers are a bit small (especially everything other than the pulse ox number), but they are sharp and bright  enough for me to read without my readers, so kudos to them for that!"
45,Bren,4.0,"Kind of temp sensitive, but good overall","  I keep one of these in my pocket after some issues recently. Readings get kind of janky if it's cold (like, 60* or less) or if it's being jiggled (like in a moving car) but for the most part, it's pretty accurate. Long battery life as well, with a visible charge meter on the readout."
46,Kathleen Meyer,5.0,Peace of Mind for COVID-19 Times,"  After reading about how easily unnoticed breathing problems can creep up on those of us with co-morbidities for COVID-19, I bought 2 of these nifty devices, 1 for me (asthma) and 1 for my older sister (cancer survivor, COPD).  It's super-easy to use--just put in the included batteries, press the on button, and place your fingertip between the cushions to get a quick level.  The oxygen level is the largest number on the display, but I do recommend reading the operation manual, because it explains how it reads your oxygen level so fast and what the additional readings mean.  It turns off about 10 seconds after you remove your finger, so the batteries should last a long time.  My doctor approved when I told him I bought a pulse oximeter because I've been anxious about the virus, and it puts my mind at ease when I feel stressed, or when my chest feels ""tight"".  It also comes with a lanyard and a carry case with a belt loop, but it's small enough to fit in a pocket or small purse.  This is a quality product with an affordable price, so I highly recommend it."
47,JO,5.0,Great little tool!,"  I have asthma and very often have difficulty breathing. I purchased this Oximeter because, between the smoke from wildfires and the Covid restrictions I was unable to get into my doctor's office when needed and could only do video meetings. She recommended I buy an oximeter so she could keep tabs on my breathing and have some data to work with when we met via video. This meter does a great job. when I finally got into the doctor's office, she noted that my meter was almost as accurate as the one in her office.It was affordable and accurate and i would recommend it to anyone!  Thanks for a great product."
48,TrueReview,5.0,"Accurate, easy to read.","  When the pandemic started in March, I picked one of these up on the advice of a friend in healthcare. I liked it so much, I bought another one to keep as a back-up for my Mom who has severe asthma. The pulse ox reading matches the reading at my doctor's office so I believe this is an accurate device. Light up display and eady to read. Make sure your finger is pushed all the way into the device, though. With so many people being asked to monitor their symptoms at home these days, this is an important piece of equipment to have."
49,Subha,2.0,Flimsy / cheaply made -- does not feel worth the money,"  I bought this yesterday. It arrived in a nice-looking box, but that's where nice things end. The product build quality is flimsy, and it does not feel solid at all. Basically a cheap 'no brand' item appears to be rebranded as Santamedical. When you put finger in it takes a while to recognize and stabilize the reading -- I suspect this is due to weak spring action (again the cheaply made build shows!). The display oled is beautiful, but what's the point if the reading is taking forever and the product is sub-par! Finally, inserting the lanyard is more than painful because the holes are super tiny, and when I managed to do it after 10 minutes of effort, the plastic joints (upper/lower parts) gave way and the lanyard came off the unit. What a shame! This is going back!"
50,TexasGrams,3.0,Not accurate,"  I purchased a month ago to monitor my oxygen level due to having covid. The first week it fit whatever finger I chose to put it on and the readings were accurate as far as I know.However, now it does not fit properly on my finger. It is very loose fitting and the readings are definitely all over the place or do not register at all.It did not hold up. Would not recommend."
51,sea breeze,2.0,Never again,"  I bought this because we had Covid and I wanted to monitor our O2 and pulse. Mine consistently showed my O2 levels in the low 90's unless I took deep, deep breaths. My pulse, however, was consistently in the high 90's -mid 100's.  After 5 weeks, it was still the same so I was concerned and went to the dr. My O2 was 98 and my pulse was in the 70's, even after I got up and walked around. Not happy at all!You can't read it well but the first picture shows the O2 at 91 and the pulse reading 106!"
52,Mansel,4.0,It provides the information I need,"  Most oximeters would not require a cute little storage bag for protection, so I don't know why they include one.  Another thing that I did not understand is  the ""perfusion index"" number.  I still do not know what is normal or average.  The only thing that I have found since the range is from 2% (low) to 20% (high).  But it does give fairly accurate numbers for blood oxygen and heart rate."
53,Shoe guy,5.0,Know your numbers in an instant!,"  This unit is easy to read and has fast results.  The bright blue screen can be read in sun and at night.  I have tried the pic and video but did not work.  I’ve written this review 3 times.  Oh, the battery level is also shown on main screen to give confidence that readings are correct.  I’ve got family members who have issues - this will make a great stocking stuffer that may save a life."
54,Andre,5.0,On the mark,"  Used it when I palpated my pulse at 130 when I had a fever, then compared it with a LifePak15 and it gave similar readings. It seems a bit fragile but otherwise good on scene as another tool in patient assessments."
55,Amazon Customer,3.0,"Warranty QR is faulty, can't get lanyard attached.","  I bought this to replace an identical one that seems to have ""grown feet"".  While the unit works very well, the lanyard holes are SO small I had to pry the case open slightly to get the loop in.  That's -1 *.Then I went to use the QR code to register the unit and it keeps sending me to Google Messenger, with no alternative way to register it.  That cost the 2nd *."
56,Kayla Bontrager,2.0,Worked Great…. For 4 weeks,"  Read well and really helped us better monitor my father in laws O2. But 4 weeks later it just quit working. Like died out of nowhere quit working. His O2 drops in the 60’s while walking. So it’s kind of a big deal if we can’t monitor it, especially when it dies out of nowhere at 2am. Causing us to be on edge until Walmart opened to purchase another. If you don’t need this for a medical issue or reliability sure it’s $14, otherwise save your money and buy a more dependable product."
57,Rick B.,3.0,The Meter,"  I have been using this product for about a month or so, it appears to be ok. you should be able to adjust the viewing angle either vertical or horizontal for easier reading. i have had others and most have that adjustment. The other item i don't like is the way it sits on your finger, with the current adjustment if you set your hand on your lap the meter will fall off."
58,Penny Borden,3.0,Fits Loose,"  This pulse ox fits loose on your finger. It will suddenly stop working, then start back up. Has done so repeatedly. I bought 2, opened one and will be returning them both. I really wish I could find one like the very first I bought, but it's no longer available anywhere. I had higher hopes for this one with it's ability to also register heart rate as a sinus rhythm."
59,willie,5.0,Helpful tool to monitor changes in blood oxygen levels,"  First, this is not an approved medical device, and should not be used to make medical diagnoses.  I use it to compare relative variations in oxygen saturation levels.  It appears to be reliable, and gives me good feedback, such as the oxygen level increasing when I do deep breathing (deep breathing should increase oxygen levels, and this shows that it does). This device has been helpful to me."
60,Woodsborne,5.0,Can be worn around your neck in a handy pouch,  I have stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma. I can't let my oxygen go below 90. This handy little gadget is always with me. I love that it came with batteries. And it's instant accessibility in the neck porch. It's all good.  Woodsborne
61,Kabz,1.0,Wildly inaccurate,  This meter said I have a 53%-60% oxygen reading.My doctor said that would mean I am basically dead.I am very much alive.Doctor also said some covid patients have 80% who are hospitalized.Products like this shouldn’t be sold without the explanation of entirely defective products being a possibility.Avoid this company and device at all costs.Get something from a reputable company known for medical devices.I’m disturbed by how much panic this inaccurate reading caused.
62,B. B. Sizemore,5.0,Works Great!,  This is so easy to use and it seems very accurate.  When my gym required us to wear a mask while exercising inside I decided to buy this to make sure my oxygen level didn't go too low.  I have asthma and breathing while wearing a mask in a high impact class sometimes makes me feel as though I can't get enough air.  I would definitely buy this again.
63,Duane,5.0,Accurate,  We bought this because my wife and our daughter both have asthma. It's accurate as it reads the same oxygen level on them as the oximeters the doctors use. Plus the pulse feature is also very accurate. Very easy to use and read.
64,Katherine,1.0,"You will be buying something which you will replace soon, buy a different one.","  The cover to the battery area comes off every time I use the instrument. The readout of data is upside down, if you curl your finger to read it, it is upside down.  It is meant to be read by an associate, clumsy. Lastly, you are buying something to take relatively important health data, don’t skim on cost. There is nothing that this instrument has to cause interest except cost. Spend a few more $ and buy a reliable accurate easy to read instrument."
65,DZ,5.0,Compact amd easy to carry,"  Love this little pulse-ox. I have used it once and it gave me a good reading, that I would expect (as a retired nurse).  It is easy to use and comes with its own little case and lanyard, for easy carrying around the neck or on a coat hook."
66,Philly Kat,4.0,"Great product, but where’s the RESULTS CHART?!?","  It was easy to use- put in batteries, hit start button. That’s it! Clear read outs, but can’t find ANYTHING enclosed that states what the NUMBERS MEAN!! No chart, quick start, scanned website- WHERE ARE THE RESULTS LISTED?!?  That’s why I lowered the Review- hopefully someone will see this, and Contact/Rectify with a RESULTS GUIDE."
67,Ms. King,4.0,Handy little product,  It's lightweight and easy to use.  I like that it also displays perfusion rate.
68,Joseph,1.0,Great price but it didn't last long.,  I bought this 1/13/21 and it no longer works.  It was never dropped or misused.  It worked from the first day I got it and stopped working 2/24//21.  I can't return it because it is 12 days past the return policy.  I would not recommend this product.
69,J Smith,1.0,This is not 5-star quality,  Very cheaply made. You can't even rotate the display so you can read it on someone's finger. Even cheaper ones have the option or even have an auto rotating display. The hing feels like it will snap at any second when using. I am returning it. The $7 version I previously purchased seems to exceed this in ever aspect. Skip this and buy something else.
70,Richard Vander Meide,5.0,Very Nice Pulse Oximeter. Great Value,  The SantaMedical SM-519BR-BL Pulse Oximeter I ordered from Amazon.I found it to be an exceptional device and of great value.I especially like the PI Index feature indicating the Perfusion Index and found it to be a noteworthy function.I also like that the graph is auto calibrating and the readings are accurate.Thank you for a great product.Sincerely;A Happy Customer
71,Delaware Don,5.0,Great O2 Monitor,"  Great O2 monitor and definitely something good to have around in case you get sick these days.  Display is easy to read and has good contrast, though the letters and numbers are a bit small.  You can see it updating as you wear it and the heart data matches other methods of measuring pulse.  This unit looks just like the ones used by my General Doctor."
72,CC,5.0,Easy to use,"  This shows pulse as well as oxygen and has a heart beat line as well. Only quibble is the information with it doesn't tell what the PI% means. Have to look that up elsewhere. (Perfusion index: pulse strength at the point it is being taken, .02 (weak) - 20 (strong), in case you wondered. If its weak, try a different finger!"
73,SPera,1.0,Turns off without giving reading,  It only worked 3 times. It doesn’t give a reading it stays on thinking mode and then turns off.
74,SpringIsBACK,4.0,Readings seem consistent.,"  The readings made by this Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter have been consistent for myself (98-99) and for other family members (usually 99).  We had no problem with varying finger sizes, although I am unsure of the fit to very large fingers.  None of us use nail polish, so we could not judge any effect from that. The unit is easy to use, except the display characters could be a little bigger.  If I get a chance to compare accuracy to a ""professional"" Oximeter, I will update this review."
75,Rudy,2.0,Not accurate or sturdy build...,  I bought this for my parents I'm comparing to another brand I purched off Amazon but this device has such a poor build quality...everything from the plastic to the spring hinge just look like it won't last one small drop..it works ok if you have normal size fingers but it will give you about 30 seconds of wrong readings before it's close to what looks normal.  My dad has large hands and thick figures and it would just not even read his vitals. The measuring device wasn't strong enough to detect his oxygen or pulse...it was just blank...I would pass on this...not sure why it's amazon choice
76,mec526,5.0,Highly recommend,  I purchased this about a month ago and use it several times a day.I have to keep track of both of my oxygen and my heart rate. This works very well for me.I have had several and the Santa Medical is my favorite.  I highly recommend this one as my readings compare well with my Doctor's.
77,C.S.,3.0,Not as accurate,  Not as accurate as I thought. I wounded up going to the hospital for Covid and they also have a finger oximeter and the reading was completely different than mine. I argued w/ them because that’s not what i was getting on mine so they went & got a different one & there’s were the same reading yet mine was off.
78,Tuna,5.0,Check your oxygen level this makes it easy,  After a family member was diagnosed with heart failure it was storming recommended that they check their blood oxygen levels periodically. This device has made it possible. I have no standard against which I could check it for accuracy but it did seem to agree with the doctors oximeter when at his office.2
79,Cinder,1.0,Oximeter does not Give Reading!,  Received and it does not give readings at all. It come on trying to work then it shuts itself off. I paid the higher price for it believing SantaMedical made quality Oximeter.  Very Disappointing!
80,sara,1.0,Very wrong readings,"  Very wrong readings. My phone reads better, it keeps messing up my reading, and i test on different devices as well as manually, and this usually gives really off reading"
81,GD King,4.0,A little slow,"  I had a different brand before this one that gave the results faster.  This one is a little slow to wait for results, and the readout is kinda small.  I am going to look back in my Amazon orders and buy another of the one I had last time, which I gave to my dad to monitor his COPD oxygenation."
82,David Paule,2.0,"At Best, This Is So-So.","  The display has small, jagged digits which are hard to read. There's no provision to change the direction the display is oriented to. Threading the lanyard through the tiny holes is an exercise for magicians. I eventually used a shop magnifier to help. The lanyard itself is slightly short and a bit too wide but otherwise functional.On the other hand, the unit is light weight and easy to use. The reading matches that of my other, better unit.There have got to be better units out there and it's worth paying a bit more for one. Keep looking."
83,Empowered x1000,5.0,Santamedical Pulse Oximeter,"  I have never owned any other pulse oximeters. This is my first. So I can't really measure the performance of this oximeter to others I've had in the past. But so far, it seems accurate. It's easy to use with a display that provides detailed info. And it comes with a handy carrying pouch. I'm happy with it."
84,Hector,3.0,Pulse not very accurate! Oxygen not sure? Not recommended!,  Pulse is not very accurate. My heart rate reads at 44-49bpm. The app on my iPhone is more accurate because I compared it to the hospital monitor when I was there for a few days. Oxygen reading bounces around too much so I am very skeptical about its accuracy! I am not happy with this product!
85,Jacob Pike,3.0,Oxygen monitor works great But....,"  The oxygen sensor appears to be very accurate and shows instantaneous changes in oxygen level, however, the heart rate monitor does not show instantaneous changes in heart rate like my old Santa Medical oximeter did. This monitor shows one heart rate and calculates some percentage value that I don't quite understand."
86,C. Olson,5.0,Bright and easy to read,  The display is large and easy to read in normal room light or in the dark.  The price was a pleasant surprise too!  Some time ago I bought an oximeter with a plain LED display ( no light)  and payed more for it.  This is the same kind they use in the doctors office.  MUCH better than my old one.
87,Johnny Vegas,5.0,Peace of mind,"  Bought this while battling Covid caused pneumonia, at home. My oxygen was 84 when I went to the doctor. He suggested ER. I didn't want to do that, so I bought this and kept an eye on my oxygen. It never went lower, and as it rose I was a lot les concerned! And so was the wife. This is worth having for sure."
88,Rik,5.0,Exactly what I wanted,"  I ordered this oximeter because it wasn't full of all sorts of things either I wouldn't know its purpose/interpretation and would be very easy to use. It didn't hurt that it was also on sale. Unless one needs to know more than their Sp02, pulse rate and perfusion index, this device should more than suffice and won't break the bank."
89,A. Lee Bennett Jr.,1.0,"Good for a week, then display garbled","  Product received and worked well for about 6 days, then suddenly the display only showed garbled patterns. Attempted complete battery replacement to no avail. Amazon offered refund since it wasn’t eligible for return. Will seek a different brand."
90,Jj Florida,5.0,Great product,"  I have been using this product to keep checking our numbers. I concentrate on the oxygen levels and it seems to be very consistent.  Hopefully, we will never need it detect lower levels, but I wish we had this in March when we were fighting covid- like illness but could not get tested.  I'm not in the medical field to confirm its accuracy, but it's been very consistent for us."
91,Karen,4.0,works fine,"  It works as well as my old one.  The only downside is the ribbon used on the ""lanyard"" .  It connects to the container rather than the oximeter itself.  My old one had the lanyard attached to the oximeter itself and wasn't made from ribbon which probably won't be very longlasting."
92,KOMHURLB,3.0,"Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2)","  BEWARE! The PulseOx - Oxygen analyzer - is NOT accurate. I bought this to monitor a family member's oxygen level due to COVID. It is NOT accurate. The heart rate is accurate though. If you only need to monitor heart rate, this works well. Do not buy this if you need an accurate oxygen analysis."
93,Patrick T. Narcisi,5.0,Reliable,"  I use it to check in each day with my health care provider.  It appears to be accurate.  It is well-made, light, and easy to use."
94,Gravity,4.0,Easy to use,"  I like this little pulse oximeter, it is easy to read. The only thing that bothers me about it is that it jumps around a lot with its readings. This makes me wonder about the accuracy I guess. It will jump from 97% to 95% to 96% all within a few seconds... maybe this shows it is very sensitive? Not sure... but it is easy to read."
95,Prime  Customer,4.0,Instructions were not clear for some readings,"  We like the ease of use. We were going through Covid and needed to know our oxygen levels daily.  I understood that reading, the pulse reading, but I never could find out in the instructions what the last lower reading meant in plain English.  The unit is excellent otherwise."
96,Eric Haag,5.0,Complete data,  I have on several palsy oximeter‘s and this one appears to be of the higher quality of those I have used. I really appreciate the accuracy measurement on it as well as the oxygen and pulse capabilities. The case it comes in is very durable and will be great when we travel.
97,shannon r.,5.0,"Just what I needed, my Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Monitor","  I got interested in this device as I realize the importance of monitoring my oxygen levels after going to the doctor and found out I was wheezing and my oxygen level was low and especially with the covid-19 pandemic, its very imperative to monitor one's oxygen level. Very easy to use and the carry case its just ideal, its size allows it fit easily in any handbag pouch with ease. The reading is instant. Very pleased with this item!!"
98,DaveTheCoffeeGuy,3.0,Quit working after 2 months,"  I had Covid so I bought this to keep an eye on my pulse rate and worked very well.. Took it out of the drawer two months later and it didn't work. Tried new batteries and still nothing.. I have not tried to get support yet, waiting on some fresh batteries to make sure.."
99,Denise,5.0,Easy to use,"  Easy to use, compact and light. Easy read out. Good price also."
100,Amazon Customer,5.0,Great price,"  Works perfectly and came with a nice pouch to keep lint out. Never buy these at retail stores because they will charge you twice as much. As a nurse,  I go through a lot of these. I always purchase from Amazon. Haven’t been disappointed by one yet."
101,Annie,1.0,A huge disappointment,  It worked once shortly after I got it. The next week I had to put in new bats. It still didn't work. Pitched it out.
102,Carl David,4.0,Just right,"  This device is easy to set up and use. It reports %oxygen saturation and pulse rate on the face of it accurately. It comes with a cord that allows one to keep the device connected around your neck.It works great in that the results are instant, easy to read, and require only 2 x AAA battery power.I like the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses. It’s nice also that the power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time.The fine prints are hard to read I wish there is a video link tutorial on how to follow in a more user-friendly manner"
103,Ray,5.0,Great Product!,"  Had this item recommended to me and I am glad I got it.  I needed an easy to use, accurate device to give me my heart rate so I could tell if I was exercising in the right zone.  I actually found from the initial reading I was working harder than I needed and now I pace myself much better."
104,Condor 27,5.0,VERY CONVENIENT,"  I just received this item.  It is compact, came with the batteries, a lanyard and a nice case for it.  I have already used it today and it appears to be very accurate and in sync with another oximeter on my watch. Very happy with this item."
105,Mb & Chad,5.0,Great tool!,"  Works great, but dark nail polish can give inaccurate results. I haven’t had my nails done this entire pandemic and I hate cutting them myself because then they peel. So, after I couldn’t get an accurate reading on this, I cut my nails down & repainted a lighter color, now it works fine.Stay safe everyone!"
106,Ravi,5.0,Accurate compared with Apple watch and bicep cuff blood pressure machine,"  Picked this up with the whole COVID stuff causing O2 abnormalities. Came in handy when I was hit with a COVID scare. Compared this with Apple watch and a blood pressure machine I have. Heart Rate is spot on with both of them. 1-3bpm variation due to timing of each machine, but that's expected."
107,Alexandra Brennan,5.0,Blood Oxygen Reader A Must,"  My husband tested positive for Covid and had a very low oxygen level which can produce clots and be fatal.  He uses this great little reader each day to keep things in check.  After a certain age or when fighting a bronchial cough, this reader will monitor levels and help the user make a decision if they should seek medical attention."
108,eskimodoc,5.0,great  brand,"  we already had an older version but got a second one for hikes, family members... This is less expensive than the first, but works just as well...solid signal, pulse accurate (which means it is getting a good read), and sats are making sense and consistent"
109,Maj Mack,5.0,Don't be without one Covid-19 is real!,"  Very easy to use right out of the box. Read instructions, put in batteries, used it on my wife and myself. We purchased this because a friend that is hospitalized with Covid-19 and one of the first symptoms was low blood oxygen. We decided this would be a good investment in today's environment."
110,gac914,5.0,This thing is VERY impressive!!,"  Right out of the box, this meter works and looks great! Comes with a really nice ballistic nylon case. (One of) the things that's really nice is it takes simple, AAA batteries. No hunting around for some obscure ""button battery."" It works fast, has a very readable screen, and the shipping was ultra-fast!!"
111,Chad H,5.0,Works well,  This product arrived in a timely manor and works well. I've owned it for a few months now and can say that it will probably give me future trouble free operation. I would recommend it to somebody looking to purchase one of these.
112,Jayareos,3.0,Accuracy,  I did not like the fact that it is always-2 for the oxygen sensor. Is it even tells you in the manual. Compared it with other Devices and this one was always 2 to 3 points above what it really was.
113,Carolyn,1.0,Does not read  through finger nail polish,"  This product does not read through finger nail polish and it has a block in front so it does not work with long nails either.  My husband tried it and it works for him, but it is very slow to read."
114,E. M. Nacoya,3.0,Too slow.,"  It takes too long to read. I purchased another years ago and I should have sent this one back, it was a backup but not much use to me. I would not recommend it, simply because it does not suit me."
115,Darnell,5.0,Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter,"  Slip it on the fingertip, press button, then receive accurate results in 5 - 7 seconds.  I verified pulse rate against my blood pressure monitor and the santamedical was within one or two beats every time."
116,Sandy Vestal,5.0,Great Value,  This is a great product for the price and is efficient and accurate.  I compared it to the reading from one used at a doctor's office within minutes and they were the same. Considering local stores wanted 39.00 for one (different brand) I was very pleased with the purchase and recommend it if you are in need of one.
117,Joe B,5.0,Love it,"  Got it due to this whole COVID thing, actually got COVID and it was really helpful to measure my O2 quickly when I would panic and think I was out of breath, turns out I was not, just panicking, but the device is quick and easy to use."
118,bluebonnet1109,5.0,Works Well,"  Reads color of blood in skin.  If Push finger against wall skin turns white, no blood. Same here. DO NOT PRESS, Insert finger GENTLY, hold finger Up in air, DO NOT TOUCH WITH OTHER HAND. HAND MUST BE WARM WARM. WORKS WELL."
119,pushfrog5,5.0,Worth it,  This was well worth the money for the reduction in anxiety. I work as a nurse and having the ability to check vitals on my loved ones at home is totally worth it. This seems accurate and I like that it has a waveform to show if the reading is a true reading. We gauge accuracy by the waveform at work so having a waveform to check is really nice. Easy to clean and has a case which is nice. Especially with COVID this has been great to have as a check on how loved ones are doing without having to go to a clinic.
120,Bob Jones,5.0,Easily obtains a reading.,"  Our other O2 sensor was highly reviewed like this one, but was not as good at picking up a pulse and a reading. I especially like the continuous graph for the pulse strength readout."
121,Susan K. Gotthelf,5.0,Easy to use,  I liked this Santamedical pulse oximeter...easy to use and it does not fall off my finger....Only thing I was disappointed in was the cheap satchel to keep it in and the flimsy ribbon attached to device.....that could certainly use some cosmetic improvements.
122,Kevin M.,5.0,Precise when compared to hospital medical equipment.,  The display shows all you need for O2 and more. It even tracks that it's placed correctly.
123,Bob M,2.0,Unreliable,"  I normally don’t write reviews but thought I should warn the public. The first issue I have is I rarely get any data on the screen when I use it. I’ve used multiple fingers and it feels like I won a game whenever I see actual “numbers”.  Second issue, if I do get data , I’ll get unreliable numbers as seen in picture. I’m not a rabbit...."
124,customer,4.0,Good,  It was pretty easy to use but then you have to look at the instructions. I hate that you have to turn up button on to get it to work. It tells you to use it on a different finger than your first finger. It is a little bit difficult to read but not horrible. I kept it because it is good enough. The readability is the biggest issue other than that it's pretty good
125,JJ,5.0,very cool and useful device,"  this little thing is awesome.  For less than twenty bucks, to get this biofeedback, that is not only useful for diagnosing issues, but also just plain good to know about the way your body is working is just cool.  I check my stats multiple times a day just to make sure everything is working correctly.  It only takes like 5 -10 seconds - why not?!"
126,David G,5.0,Feeling a Little More Secure,  My partner has developed some minor heart issues. She checked the Pulse Oximeter when she went to her doctor and found it almost Spot On. Now we have a Great Way to assist us at home for both of us.
127,Glenda J Zinsitz,5.0,"Good price, quality and accurate instrument, and fast delivery.","  Even though it says it is not intended for medical use, I am a nurse and it works wonderfully, and I like seeing the plethysmograph wave form, and the perfusion index. My own primary care provider told me to get a pulse ox for my asthma, and allergy problems with oak pollen, to do occasional oxygen sat checks. This fits my needs! When I do physical exertion, it helps to know my sats do not go to low. Thanks!"
128,Shellie Stinson,2.0,Extremely flimsy,  A lot of fluctuations in the readings. Not well made. Broke easily.
129,Derrick,5.0,Definitely worth the purchase.,  Works great me and my wife had Covid-19 so I ordered this to watch our oxygen and it saved my wife life as her oxygen dropped to 86% and I was able to get her to the hospital in time
130,Tripp,5.0,Pretty accurate,  I’ve had couple of these and this one by far is the best. Easy to read & pretty accurate. Only complaint is mine was missing the battery cover but I just put tape over it.
131,brianna webster,5.0,Absolutely would recommend.,  This is our 2nd one we have bought. Our 1st we gave to my father when he had covid and it was fantastic. My husband is a PE survivor and we keep track of his O2 levels. It is extremely accurate.
132,Linda Z,5.0,O2 sensor is imperative to have if dealing with patients that have pneumonia or severe Covid-19.,"  My husband had Covid-19 and dealt with low O2 levels so I relied on this one and one I already had. It was because I was watching his O2 levels that I made a decision to bring him into ER for a third time. They had dipped down to 85 and lower. He was admitted for 2 days and released with oxygen for two weeks, which helped him overcome the problems he was having. Used the O2 sensors dozens of times for 4 weeks."
133,Mystic Daizy,5.0,Easy to read Display,"  After my son got out of the hospital with covid-19 we needed one of these to monitor his o2. Arrived quickly and able to use it soon as he was home. Quick read, easy bright display."
134,art albert,1.0,UNRELIABLE READINGS,"  Pulse readings were grossly unreliable. Sometimes ridiculously low, sometimes way high. Oximeter readings were highly variable (87, then five minutes later 98). Often I would press the button, insert finger and the display would light up, appear to be computing and give no reading at all. Junk!"
135,Jczarnec,5.0,Fast and Accurate,"  It only takes a few seconds to get readings.  The numbers are easy to read in daylight or in darkness.  The pulse rate is accurate; I have no way to check the accuracy of the oxygen level.  The number does rise slightly when I do deep breathing, and then goes back down after a while to the original number, so it appears to be working.  I am very happy with this device."
136,Ed L. Stephas,4.0,Great value.,  So far so good.  Granted I've only had this product for a few hours it is easy to use>  My only complaint thus far is that the directions do not describe what the PI% means - although I did a quick Google search and figured it out.
137,Ash,5.0,Works well,"  I tested this as follows. Exhaling all air from my lungs and then holding my breath until I need to breathe: reads at 90 then slowly climbs to 99 as I start breathing. Start with full breath at 99 and then abruptly hold my breath for as long as I can: plunges from 99 to 95 to 90, then slowly climbs to 99 when I breath. And slowly exhaling: slowly goes from 99 one to two points at a time until 90, then slowly climbs to 99 when I breath."
138,Lavelle W.,3.0,Battery compartment,  Loved it readings are great  an clear my only complaint  is the battery compartment the cover is loose won't stay on will fall off other than that it's a great prodict
139,CyberSOFT Creative,5.0,Easy to use and reasonably priced,  I have no point of reference for the O2 reading to determine accuracy. However the heart rate reading is within a couple of points of the blood pressure machine I have
140,kittypoo m,5.0,Great accuracy,  To have one of these while trying to recover at home from the Covid-19 made a big difference.  I could check my oxygen levels at anytime and my pulse.  This is a must have in every home.  Good price and great accuracy.
141,CrhRN,5.0,Perfect! Works great!,  Bought this for my Dad when he got covid. I don't live nearby so I needed to be able to check on him. He sent me frequent pictures of his O2 sats to keep me updated!
142,EC,5.0,Reads oxygen level like the pros!,  Got hit with Covid and this instrument was instrumental in helping monitoring not only mine oxygen but my mother in laws oxygen level. My mother in law got her own and we both use it regularly on our road to recovery. As an asthmatic I find it very helpful managing my oxygen level also.
143,James Gracely,5.0,"Good, simple pulse oxygen meter",  Very nice product that does just what it claims. We measured this and another brand against the pulse ox meter at a clinic and this one was spot on. Great little product to have around in this time of worry.
144,Jeff,5.0,good item,"  This seems to do the job just fine - did use a YouTube video to help clarify some of the aspects of it - figured things out and keep it on hand to use when needed,"
145,Jessie D.,5.0,Excellent,  ! I’ve heard it’s important to have a pulse oximeter  especially during this time of Covid. This is an excellent one! I am very pleased with how easy it is to use and read.  I will be buying a second one for my parents!
146,ann mingerink,5.0,Top notch pulse oximeter,"  This pulse ox lives up to its description.  After fast arrival, it was put to immediate use and delivered quick results of my husband’s oxygen and heart rate.  The one we had recently bought gave wrong information, so we were very happy to find this oximeter giving consistently correct readings. We are quite pleased with this product and highly recommend it!"
147,Glenda Robles,5.0,Check your levels!,"  So a funny thing happened, I got covid. Wife was being pain about making sure I was going to live, so she bought this item to check my levels every few hours. I made it though it and this little thing worked like a charm. Jokes on her, she caught it and made it."
148,Bobby,4.0,Easy to use and good quality,  The OLED screen is clear and easily read. Accuracy seems good but I haven't yet compared it to my doctors test unit. It is erratic when used on a finger with nail polish so users of nail polish should be aware of this otherwise excellent device.
149,Sba,5.0,It’s very lightweight,  Looks nice but very lightI expected it to be heavier. I haven’t washed it yet. I hope it will hold up. If it doesn’t I’ll return because they said it was washable.
150,Nancy D.,5.0,Easy to use and accurate.,"  As some others have said, it’s a good idea to check your blood oxygen level in these COVID times.  The reading was the  same as the one at my doctor’s office.  It’s very easy to use, and batteries were included."
151,Denise21,2.0,"Display Scratched/Scuffed, Feels Cheaply Made","  This pulse ox came with a case, 2 AAA batteries, lanyard, manual, & a registration card. Product box appeared sealed but it has scuff/scratch marks on the display of the pulse oximeter. Was this used?? It feels light in the hands (like a cheaply made plastic toy) even with the batteries installed, hinges felt like it was going to fall apart. I wasn't expecting it to be 'heavy' but I prefer the weight of a sturdy/well made pulse ox. I can't say if it operates as it should as I plan to return this item if it's not too much of a hassle."
152,Dog Mom,1.0,Complete Garbage,  I purchased this item to monitor my levels while I am sick. Used it once and it worked well. Tried it again and nothing. It turns on but doesn’t do anything then turns itself off. Total waste of money. Buyer be ware. Non-returnable.  Shop elsewhere!!
153,Robert 60,3.0,It works.,"  Pulse Fingertip , it’s ok , but it’s cheap made . Works great .But I don’t like how cheap it feels.But for the price I guess I can’t complain. Lol"

156,R. Marko,5.0,Nice pulseox meter,  Seems like a good product. I had a different one from another company which did not have a replaceable battery. This one takes 2 AAA batteries which I like.
157,JC,5.0,Great buy!,"  I've purchased 3 of these for family members, and all are quick, accurate, and easy to use.  I appreciate the lanyard and protective case.  I use this in my morning screening routine, along with using a forehead thermometer.  Worth the money for peace of mind!"
158,CK,5.0,"Excellent, Accurate Pulse Oximeter","  After having to return one for inaccuracy, I was so pleased that the Santa Medical Oximeter worked correctly the minute I turned it on.  And it has a battery reading as well.  Very satisfied with this product!"
159,Tara,2.0,Definitely don’t recommend,"  The readings seem to be accurate and easy to read but I’m unsatisfied with the quality of the pulse ox. It appears to be made of cheap flimsy plastic and the hinges aren’t tight, making the two parts slide around when opening it."
160,BrendaY,2.0,varies,  It takes a long time for info to come on screen and then the figures bounce up and down i.e. O2 will show 99 then drop to 92 then jump up to 96.  Not consistant.
161,Rjich01,5.0,Excelente producto,"  Excelente producto, muy fácil de usar se apaga al quitarlo del dedo a los 10 segundos , por lo que ahorra batería , casi tan preciso como el del hospital"
162,Richard P,5.0,Great Value,  This device arrived when promised and works great.  It helps me monitor my heart rate and also my oxygen saturation levels in the blood....a good thing.

169,Jo,2.0,Poorly  put together  Feels like it will fall apart.,  This monitor feels like it will fall apart.  I'm not sure how accurate it is because of this. I have used several that have by far sturdier than this one.  I don't expect it to last long.
170,Sumosha,1.0,Not reliable,"  If this device even bothers to show any values (it often just spins and then shuts off), it gives me wildly inaccurate results like 300 bpm. I can't rely on the results to be accurate."
171,Linda G,5.0,Peace of mind,"  I sent this to a niece who, along with her husband and teenage son, was sick with Covid 19 and made an emergency trip to urgent care.  After hearing this, I immediately ordered this monitor for her.  It arrived the very next day.  She called me to express thanks for the peace of mind it gave her."
172,"Daniel, K.CarterTuffy",1.0,not that good,  Sterted using it and readings were all over the place blood oxygen at 40 and pulse at 24 knew that was wrong so went back to a ZacUvac pro series. It has been consistent and matches my doctors.
173,Savingn321,4.0,As promised,  Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter seems to be accurate. I agree with other reviewers the grip could be a little stronger. The device is as expected and order arrived complete.
174,Anthony C.,5.0,Brought this to my Primary,  At first I thought it may be off BUT brought it to my primary doctors and tested it against their machine several times and it’s exact. I was impressed.
175,martin garozzo,5.0,Good product  easy to use higher quality than most others battery cover slips off frequently,  Liked the good  advanced quality  disliked the battery cover not  being secure lost one of these because the battery cover became missing and the pulse ox was not useable
176,Fran B,1.0,Junk!,"  Too loose compared to my old one, finger is not secure, not accurate compared to my daughter's.  Will probably return.  The price was too good to be true."
177,Merylu Ledesma,5.0,"Lov it , great to have in home","  Purchased it because of covid , very easy to use very small and lightweight can carry in purse or bags comes with a carry bag and lantern and uses two Triple-A batteries"
178,Tony B.,3.0,Not solidly built as others,  The hinge feels very easily breakable and feels very easily broken  unlike the ones used at the doctors office.  It works well but be gentle with it.
179,Leti T S,5.0,Oxygen monitor,  This oxygen monitor is easy to use and easy to read. Accuracy is good. I checked it against my fitness tracker and it matched. I bought it for my COVID Kit. I want to be prepared if we get it. I recommend. Price was good.

186,Barb Cummings,1.0,DO NOT BUY!,  My husband just came home from hospital. We used this twice. Went to use this morning and no display at all. So I changed batteries still no display. This is important to have this working. What a piece of trash. Not very sturdy either.
187,PBS,5.0,Just what was needed,"  My first purchase of an pulse oximeter so really cannot compare to any others quality or expectations.  However, this item is what I needed to maintain my health needs."
188,Ken,5.0,Working well,"  I purchased this to replace another slightly cheaper monitor.  Seems that it is more consistent with what the doctor's office reported.  Only real problem was that the holes are too small to install the lanyard.  I don't need it, but if you do you might want to try another model."

194,Tonaya Smith,4.0,Takes a bit longer to acquire readings.,  Accuracy is fairly decent; although I've found this device is more sensitive to temperature of a person's hands. There are times readings will not be produced even when a patient's hands are decently warm. Straight forward to use and decent display. This pulse ox works well... when it works.
195,LikesToBike,5.0,Nicest one I've had so far,"  I had to replace an old one, and this is really nice- nice screen, adds the PI #, just all around one I'd recommend."

208,Sandi Cook,5.0,Works great.,  I suffer COPD and take oxygen. This helps make sure my saturation stays up instead of down. It does the job. When I am done it says bye-bye. And I am done now. Good unit. I recommend. I have had no troubles with it at all.

210,light~as~a~feather,4.0,Broken strap,"  I love everything about this pulse oximeter. But the strap broke when I took it out of the box. Barely even pulled on it. If I can just get a new strap, I'd give it 5 stars."
211,Third_hunter- Louetta Moncrief,5.0,Pulse oximeter,  It's ridiculous if you think you're going to thread that lanyard through that hole when you're a senior citizen and go to register the warranty
212,Michael Fisher,5.0,Quick response and accurate enough for home use,  I like the multicolor display. It is quick to get a reading and is accurate with both my other heart rate monitors for pulse. The O2 reading is clear and easy to read. You can watch it change pretty quickly as you try different breathing exercises. I am definitely happy with the purchase.

219,Anon,5.0,"It is very convenient, easy to use and gives fast results","  I rate the Oximeter at 5 out of 5 Stars!!  It is very convenient, easy to use and gives fast results.  I compared the heart rate function to another device (Apple Watch) and they were within 1 BPM.  Very satisfied so far with the Oximeter!"
220,Harald W.,5.0,Also displays heart rate to predict Afib,"  It not only works as an oximeter, but it also displays heart rate in beats per minute. This is important because an unexpected increase in heart rate can indicate Afib. Very easy to use. Stick in a finger and press a button."
221,Dorrie Watson,2.0,Disappointed,"  What I like it's compact and have its own carrying case,what I don't like its feel flimsy in my hand the no on display is small"
222,bpittman,5.0,Great workout tool.,  Use as I change activities to ensure I am recovering before overly stressing. Confirms how I am feeling. Same readings as my therapists.
223,Scott P Walter,1.0,Item received was not the same OLED but rather a 'dot matrix'...beware of this seller!,"  Do not order from this seller as the pulse ox I received was not the same as the picture.  I did not get the OLED, but some old school screen.  Also, the battery cover slides off super easy.  Seller would not take returns.  But luckily Amazon resolved this by contacting them directly"

229,R M. Schulte,5.0,Appears accurate.,  Reads the same as other unit so I guess  it's as accurate. No way of knowing for sure either one is accurate.

I have an appointment with a pulmonologist in April and she said this will help give them a heads start on the level of my condition. It works great I check my level 2x a day and more often if I'm having difficulty breathing. I rate this 5 stars.

The unit is simple to use.  It registers quickly, is comfortable, does not feel cheaply made and has a great little carrying/storage case which enables you to carry it with you and have it available when needed.  I give it a 5."

256,Marina,5.0,Good monitor,  The monitor reads pulse accurately. I didn’t have a chance to check the accuracy of SPO2 readings at the doctor’s office.I think that the monitor shows pulse and SPO2 results when I put a thermometer and paper in it because of the principles of its work. Not because it’s not accurate enough.Very easy to use and gives results quickly.
257,Vee,2.0,Breaks,"  Product works, but…The battery  door falls off (used black electrician tape for that)The lanyard was way too short (used my own)The lanyard opening located where two pieces of plastic met, and lanyard came out (used Gorilla Glue)So, aside from the readings, it was a hot mess.No recommended."

The reading I got from it exactly matched what the nurse at the doctors office got so I feel good about it’s accuracy. It was also the model that my primary care doctor recommended.
