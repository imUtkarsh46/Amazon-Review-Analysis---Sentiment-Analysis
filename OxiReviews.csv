"If you want to panic, or IF YOU WANT TO BE BRIBED, buy one of these !",1,"The first reading this morning showed I had blood oxygenation of 99% - with a pulse of 40!  Confident that I am NOT Michael Jordan, I tried a multi-device comparison. In this, my blood pressure tester showed a pulse of 76, my cheap pink meter showed a pulse of 74, and the SantaMedical showed my pulse at 56.  The BP tester was on my left arm, the two finger meters on my right hand.  All readings were taken simultaneously.  The BP device, the pink finger meter, and my subjective experience were in accordance with each other.  The SantaMedical was consistently an outlier.  I have no way to evaluate whether the PI readings are accurate or not, but I note they ranged from 1.5 to 5.0 within 10 minutes without any external variables changing.  Beautiful display.  Crazy data.  Going back!Feb 2, 2021  These vendors are incredibly - BAD.  They must have sent me at least eight emails asking me to delete this review of their defective junk.  Several plead that it is a family business and bad reviews hurt, implying that I am against family and hurting children because I've taken the time to write an honest review.In at least three of their emails to me, they have offered to bribe me.  The first bribe offer was for $30.  In the second or third, they upped their bribe offer to $35.  This, on a product that costs less than $20.  The vendors include links to facilitate deleting and or modifying my 1 star review.  (At this point it would be a negative 5 star rating if I could give that instead of a +1 star.)  I told them that if they sent me a meter that gave accurate data, that I'd test it and update this review - but no!  Their response was to tell me that because of Covid-19 they COULDN'T sent me a replacement meter.  Covid-19 doesn't, however, seem to diminish their efforts to sell more meters right here, today!  Shame on them."
Snoopy has a pulse and an oxygen reading!,1,How can we trust this device when stuffed animals generate readings? A Sharpie has a pulse of 66 and an oxygen rating of 99? We also had one individual show a pulse rate of 164 and then a minute or so later a pulse rate of 72. Not cool.
Inaccurate,1,Least accurate pulse Ox I came across. I am a MD. I use these for a living. The inaccuracy was disappointing of the oxygen reading was a disappointment. Will have to buy a different one from CVS or Walgreen. Amazon should not be carrying this device on its site.
This product does not give accurate readings.,1,Look at this carrot! It’s alive!
I cannot trust this devide readings.,1,"How something that doesn't have a pulse, no blood or moving parts like a pen and a plastic doll can get a reading?The pen was even showing 32bmp and 99 oxygen level.I will definitely return this."
Defective device,1,"I bought this item a week ago and it does not correlate with the pulse oximeter units at my job. It's not displaying an accurate reflection of a persons oxygenation status.  As a Respiratory Therapist, it's very important to have a device with accuracy.  Please do not purchase this item."
Disappointed all around...,1,"I received the pulse oximeter a few days ago, tested it a few times, and found it to be inaccurate as the ranges varied.  Today I tried it again and after a few more erratic readings, the product doesn’t turn on anymore.We chose this product based on all the 5 star reviews. However, with the product, we also received an insert offering a free gift in exchange for a review. Seems suspicious."
Poor instructions and customer support.,1,"The instructions for the device are insufficient and there are no instructions on how to hand the neck holder which is important as one could harm the device if it is improperly attached.They offer a free 4 Port USB SMart Phone Fast Charger if you reply to them with a review, but then they never followed through with deliver.Customer support was very poor and non responsive to my concerns."
Don't waste your money,1,The SPo2 reading bounces all over the place. Even after 30 seconds the reading varies so much you can not depend upon the information. The PI% reading varies from.2 to 20% - so what is the correct value.This unit was made in China - what do you expect! Don't waste your money
Wildly inaccurate,1,I experimented and put a pen in it.  It read 99% and heart rate of 167 for an object.  Friends have other Santa Medical models that do not read objects as being alive.  I feel awful for people who feel this device gives them peace of mind!  I am returning it and looking for the other Santa Medical model: SM-150BL.

I feel awful for people who feel this device gives them peace of mind!  I am returning it and looking for the other Santa Medical model: SM-150BL.
Waste of money,1,I monitor my O2 saturation due to a condition I have and this meter reads around 6-7% higher than actual levels.
Worst I have owned - ZERO stars,1,"I have several oximeters.  I had a great one from same company, but this is a flimsy, awkward, inaccurate piece of junk.  It consistently gives wildly different results when nothing has changed.It said I had a pulse of 31 while taking it manually and FitBit both were 65-66.  PI% was .9 and then jumped to 20.  SPO2 bounced between 91 and 99 while old one showed 96.  Worthless.  (My pens and pencils do have consistent oxygen level of 99, but very different pulses.)I frankly can’t believe the positive reviews, as this would be dangerous if actually needed for anything serious."
"Unhappy with this product, cannot trust its readings",1,I  sent an email to this company about my concerns for the accuracy of this product and requested a replacement.  The pulse can read over a hundred then drop rapidly to the 30's  within a few seconds.  The  actual pulse rate was in the 60s or 70s. When I reached out to the company I was told this is a common problem and to either rub my hands together for a couple of minutes or put my hand under warm water before taking a reading. I tried it and that did not work either. If the pulse is not close to being accurate I do not feel I can trust the O2 reading.I have owned an earlier model of this device and used it for over 3 years with great results. This earlier device was accurate to within 1-2 beats without having to warm my hands first.Unfortunately I can not recommend this new model.
Junk - Don't Buy This!!,1,"This pulse oximeter is poorly made and completely inaccurate. I bought this for my mom because she has an irregular heartbeat that was not being medically managed until a recent trip to the hospital. When I got it, I tested it out on myself. As a registered nurse, I know how this thing is supposed to work and a person's pulse doesn't jump around the way this meter was reading my pulse. I compared it to another pulse ox reader I have. Mine showed a steady pulse rate and the heart rate readings from this one were all over the place. Its also poorly constructed and appeared to be either broken or about to fall apart. I'm returning it. This is a complete aggravation because my mom needs this and now I have to wait another 2 days for a better one to arrive.From a medical professional's opinion....don't buy this junk if you're managing a serious health condition because it doesn't work accurately. You'll end up at the hospital over false readings!!!!****Buy this one instead. Its extremely accurate!! Found it on Amazon:Tomorotec Fingertip Pulse Oximeter Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor with Silicon Cover, Batteries and Lanyard (Black)"
Most expensive pulse ox and absolutely worthless,1,"When I put it on my finger, the readings vacillate between 99 and 90, never settling on any particular number.  I purchased it because I have cancer and wanted something at home for self-monitoring during the pandemic.  I didn't have a chance to return it within the return window, so I am stuck with a $65 piece of plastic."
No es preciso,1,No resulta fidedigno el resultado
Improper closure,1,"Poorly made. Opened it, put finger in and it would not close properly. The top closed at a slight angle. Wouldn’t enclose finger.Returning it."
Inaccurate.  Do not purchase from SantaMedical.,1,"Junk, stay away from Santa Medical.I have never gotten a measurement below 98 using this device, and thought my O2 sats were doing great.  I was in the ER the other day and measured my fingertip pulse oximeter against the ER oximeter for 4 hours.  My SpO2 was 94 to 97, but this device measured my O2 at 99 the entire time.  The only thing worse than having no pulse oximeter is having one that’s this inaccurate. Going in the trash."
It is very large compared to other brands.,1,It is very large compared to other brands.The quality of the plastic is very cheap.
Check accuracy with healthcare provider's equipment.,1,"I purchased 2 different brands, compared to known accurate oximeter, both do not correlate.  Maybe I just unlucky twice.  But  I strongly suggest any purchased be compared to those of known healthcare provider who has accurate equipment.Update:  So I took it on a walk today to give it a 2nd chance.  The battery cover fell off in my pocket.  It at times correlated with my known accurate meter, but that did not last long.  The picture is another example.  Note it does correlate fairly well on the heart rate.  As a doctor concerned about respiratory status of ill patients using these at home, I strongly suggest all oximeters should be correlated with those of healthcare providers.Update#2  Santamedical offered to send me a replacement - will update when new unit checked."
Ordered two Pulse Ox Meters.....the seals of each of the boxes were broken,1,"I really wanted to like this product.  However, upon receiving delivery, the boxes for the two meters I received were apparently opened in that  the plastic seal on each box were broken.  I did not want to send back the meters in that I needed the meters to monitor oxygen levels in light of teh COVID pandemic......."
DO NOT BUY!!!,1,Product worked one time after I received it. Display will not come on most of the time and when it does it looks like this. Returning for a refund.
Don't buy this product!!!!,1,"Does NOT work at all!!!!I thought battery problem so check many times but NO... Does not work at all, it does not even emit lights on, disgusting!!;You don't have to be a genius to operate this, and I happen to be a nurse so figure it out!!"
"During this dangerous time, you need to have a reliable oximeter",1,"I'm in healthcare and I've used several oximeters. I do not think this one gives accurate readings. Usually the oxygen saturation will trend upwards. That's why you need to wait about 30 - 60 seconds.With this device, it's been 99 % every time. It never vacillates.I've used and given away around 10 oximeters. I've never seen one where the oxygen saturation never varies. If you want to return it, you need to call or text someone at amazon. The lady who assisted me said that my refund will be back on my card in 3 days. You cannot return it. I'll dispose of it once I see that my money has been returned to my card.During this dangerous time, you need to have a reliable oximeter. Stay away from this one."
Not Working,1,It stopped working so I replaced the batteries.  It still only flips to some very small numbers at the side of the screen.  I am sorry I wasted my money.
Item is NOT returnable although received damaged,1,"I purchased this item based on its great reviews of accuracy. Unfortunately, the top flips off every time I use it, showing the inside of the top plate (motherboard and connector). It is my own fault that I failed to notice this seller does not allow returns, even if the merchandise is damaged. Because of its weight for accuracy, I cannot repair using glue or duct tape or chewing gum to fix the problem because the accuracy may be effected."
Seems to not work with a pacemaker,1,"I have a more expensive unit from another company and decided to get a lesser expensive SpO2 monitor for outdoor activity.When I got this, I tried it out sitting down at the kitchen table. O2 readings bounced from 90 to 99 percent and everything in between. About 10 seconds after it started reading the pulse rate flatlined and the unit shut off as if my finger wasn't in it (which it still was). Grabbed the more expensive unit to compare it to and tried again sitting down using both units simultaneously. No problem with the readings on the other unit, while the Santamedical unit flatlined again in less than 5 seconds after obtaining a reading. And in that short time the O2 readings varied from 88 to 97, bouncing up and down. Would not buy if you have a pacemaker as certain sensors don't work well with them (did some research on this), and that seems to be the case with this one."
absolute junk,1,"the plethora of positive reviews makes no sense for this modelthis model is extremely disappointing compared to the santamedical 6-panel display model ... this model is flimsy, ridiculously awkward to read because it can be read only vertically, and also has VERY tiny lettering. The vertical pulse graph along the side is also completely useless as it shows no difference between systolic and diastolic oxygenation.i'm going  back to the santamedical generation 2 with large bright letters, six display modes and a very useful oxygenation graphamazon.com/Santamedical-Generation-Fingertip-Saturation-Batteries/dp/B000ORVXPA"
Expected better,1,"Box arrived damaged as seen in pics.  That’s not the real issue however, data takes too long to populate so not sure what that’s about.  Also, results seem to vary widely between uses and hinges are weak."
Inoperable,1,The product doesn't work.  It never reads your pulse or oxygen level and then shuts off.
Inaccurate and Inconsistent,1,"Did not give accurate numbers and was rarely consistent.  Took several minutes to give a reading, and when it did, it would be different every single time no matter which finger I used.  First reading said my heart rate was 25bmp and my O2 was 80%, second said my heart rate was 31bmp and my O2 was 98%, and third reading said my heart rate was 90bmp and O2 was 88%.  I noticed the hinge was a little loose, so I tried pushing it down on my finger, but it didn't change anything.  I also switched the batteries out from the ones that came with no change."
Slow readout and not particularly accurate,1,"Thought I had lost my pulse oximeter that I bought at the start of the pandemic so I order this one just in case.  This one came promptly but the readout is very slow, and inaccurate at times.  I then found my original oximeter and compared the two.  This one often gives an inaccurate initial reading and then requires minutes to update to a more accurate and consistent reading.  last time I tried it, the oximeter eventually showed my resting pulse rate as 188 and O2 level of 88.  My original one accurately showed pulse of 65 and O2 of 98.  Several minutes later this one showed O2 of 98 but never updated my pulse.  Time to return it."
Not worth the money,1,Flimsy piece of junk. Not at all like the other Santa medical oximeter I originally purchased.Description completely misrepresents item.
Broke after 9 months...customer service non-existent,1,"Mine worked fine, but after 9 months would no longer turn on, even with brand new batteries. I called the ""no-hassle"" customer service...emailed them...and left a message on their website. No response to anything. Luckily, Amazon was nice enough to honor the warranty and sent a replacement."
Wildly inaccurate,1,This meter said I have a 53%-60% oxygen reading.My doctor said that would mean I am basically dead.I am very much alive.Doctor also said some covid patients have 80% who are hospitalized.Products like this shouldn’t be sold without the explanation of entirely defective products being a possibility.Avoid this company and device at all costs.Get something from a reputable company known for medical devices.I’m disturbed by how much panic this inaccurate reading caused.
"You will be buying something which you will replace soon, buy a different one.",1,"The cover to the battery area comes off every time I use the instrument. The readout of data is upside down, if you curl your finger to read it, it is upside down.  It is meant to be read by an associate, clumsy. Lastly, you are buying something to take relatively important health data, don’t skim on cost. There is nothing that this instrument has to cause interest except cost. Spend a few more $ and buy a reliable accurate easy to read instrument."
Great price but it didn't last long.,1,I bought this 1/13/21 and it no longer works.  It was never dropped or misused.  It worked from the first day I got it and stopped working 2/24//21.  I can't return it because it is 12 days past the return policy.  I would not recommend this product.
This is not 5-star quality,1,Very cheaply made. You can't even rotate the display so you can read it on someone's finger. Even cheaper ones have the option or even have an auto rotating display. The hing feels like it will snap at any second when using. I am returning it. The $7 version I previously purchased seems to exceed this in ever aspect. Skip this and buy something else.
Turns off without giving reading,1,It only worked 3 times. It doesn’t give a reading it stays on thinking mode and then turns off.
Oximeter does not Give Reading!,1,Received and it does not give readings at all. It come on trying to work then it shuts itself off. I paid the higher price for it believing SantaMedical made quality Oximeter.  Very Disappointing!
"IT is a very very inaccurate product!, That something like this is on the market!",1,"Compared with a Fitbit this is really garbage!Could you please send me a paid return label ,I do not have a ups store in my neighborhood"
Very wrong readings,1,"Very wrong readings. My phone reads better, it keeps messing up my reading, and i test on different devices as well as manually, and this usually gives really off reading"
Disappointed,1,"Easy to use, easy to read. However when taken and tested at Drs office it is not correct. It gives a false high reading which is not what you want when you have severe lung issues."
"Good for a week, then display garbled",1,"Product received and worked well for about 6 days, then suddenly the display only showed garbled patterns. Attempted complete battery replacement to no avail. Amazon offered refund since it wasn’t eligible for return. Will seek a different brand."
Unreliable -- do not buy,1,"I've had this oximeter for almost two months. It has given me the wildest readings, such as 34% oxygen one time and a pulse rate of 34 bpm this morning. I can't trust or rely on the readings. Unfortunately, the return window has closed, so I'm out $20."
A huge disappointment,1,It worked once shortly after I got it. The next week I had to put in new bats. It still didn't work. Pitched it out.
"Waste of money, completely inaccurate",1,"It’s absolutely useless, the range of values is from 93 to 99 and back to 99 in 10 seconds.  99 is perfect and 93 is low but it doesn’t show constant reading it’s changing constantly and the range is unacceptable for medical device. It’s a toy not a medical device. I regret I wasted money on it"
Cheap Junk,1,Just spring for a good oximeter. This is flimsy and cheap. Feels like it’s going to break when you use it. It’s takes forever to get a reading and doesn’t match the better model I was borrowing from a nurse. Not worth the money.
Stopped working,1,"The device seemed to work. (have nothing to compare it to)  then 3 months to the day, then stopped working.  It was used about 1 time a week.Amazon gave me a number for the company, but it didn't work.  Would not buy again."
So much junk is sold on Amazon these days,1,They give you a Lanyard that is impossible to thread through microscopic holes. Unbelievable. The unit itself is small so without the lanyard it could easily be lost.
Does not read  through finger nail polish,1,"This product does not read through finger nail polish and it has a block in front so it does not work with long nails either.  My husband tried it and it works for him, but it is very slow to read."
piece of junk,1,"the top silicon gasket popped right off, would not stay in place no matter how carefully you tried. bad design build"
Absolutely worthless.,1,The readings vary so greatly after only a few minutes.  Not the purpose of an item that is supposed to give you an objective diagnosis.
UNRELIABLE READINGS,1,"Pulse readings were grossly unreliable. Sometimes ridiculously low, sometimes way high. Oximeter readings were highly variable (87, then five minutes later 98). Often I would press the button, insert finger and the display would light up, appear to be computing and give no reading at all. Junk!"
Complete Garbage,1,I purchased this item to monitor my levels while I am sick. Used it once and it worked well. Tried it again and nothing. It turns on but doesn’t do anything then turns itself off. Total waste of money. Buyer be ware. Non-returnable.  Shop elsewhere!!
Garbage,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   it worked for the first 5 minutes .... then shows all the time 99"
1 was broken,1,1 of the 2 I bought didn't work!
Not reliable,1,"If this device even bothers to show any values (it often just spins and then shuts off), it gives me wildly inaccurate results like 300 bpm. I can't rely on the results to be accurate."
not that good,1,Sterted using it and readings were all over the place blood oxygen at 40 and pulse at 24 knew that was wrong so went back to a ZacUvac pro series. It has been consistent and matches my doctors.
Junk!,1,"Too loose compared to my old one, finger is not secure, not accurate compared to my daughter's.  Will probably return.  The price was too good to be true."
Not workable,1,The closure for the battery house will not close. Sending it back!
DO NOT BUY!,1,My husband just came home from hospital. We used this twice. Went to use this morning and no display at all. So I changed batteries still no display. This is important to have this working. What a piece of trash. Not very sturdy either.
Broke after a month,1,Literally broke 10 days past the one month return window. Wish I could give it a zero
cheap material,1,from the very first use i t would read wrong. -it broke after the 3rd use.  do not recomend it.
Product was DOA,1,"Product was DOA, Red LED powers on, but OLED screen does not. 1 star for the product, 5 stars for Amazon's customer service."
Most of gotten a bad unit!,1,This item was defective when I got it so can’t say much. Seller did refund me my money right away with no questions asked!
Cheap,1,Cheap and Flimsy will break fast. Not happy with purchase and no refund. Buyer beware dont get this product.
Wouldn't detect the finger,1,Many times did not even detect the finger. We returned it.
Don't recommend,1,I wouldn't recommend this product.  It was broken when I received.  It went in the trash. Very disappointed
Not as good as first one I ordered!,1,The first one I ordered was better. It was through another company and cheaper. When my pulse or O2 level we’re two high or low it would beep to let me now this one does not. Quite disappointing but I have to have one.
Item received was not the same OLED but rather a 'dot matrix'...beware of this seller!,1,"Do not order from this seller as the pulse ox I received was not the same as the picture.  I did not get the OLED, but some old school screen.  Also, the battery cover slides off super easy.  Seller would not take returns.  But luckily Amazon resolved this by contacting them directly"
It doesn't deliver what you need most... accuracy,1,"Simply ""generously"" inaccurate. A person that normally has only 93-95% blood oxygen can have as high as 99% reading on this device"
Not as good as the the first one,1,"My doctor recommended that I buy and keep one of these at home as it can potentially help screen for covid.  The first one I bought was actually pretty good.  It matches the pulse oximeter readings at my doctor's office.  I decided to buy this one to keep at my work place, however, this unit turned out to be very inaccurate.  It always reads 5-7 points lower.  I wouldn't recommend it."
Doesn't work,1,"Bought new for a good price. Turned it on and red light came on, but nothing was displayed in the window. Changed out the batteries and same thing happened. I missed the return window unfortunately but I will be buying from someone else. I buy a ton of stuff from Amazon and this is first thing I've bought that doesn't work, so I guess that's pretty good track record."
Not good,1,It work for 2 weeks really good then it stopped reading wrong. It said my heart rate was 150. Oxygen was 20 I stopped using it. It's garbage.
Extremely low quality,1,"This item is of extremely low quality construction, when you take this in your hands you feel the lack of quality, and is also highly inaccurate."
Failed out of the Box,1,This unit failed hours after unpackaging.  Changed out the batteries and still no led light/scanner.  The main screen lit up - but it would not take a reading and kept turning off.  Tried toublehooting with a Customer Service Rep with no success.
Not that great I’ve had better,1,Not that great I’ve had better . Took forever to read levels. Kind big. Not as good quality as the other one I have away
Refund policy misrepresented,1,"This product is not eligible for return even though the product page states that it is: ""Return policy: Refund or replacement available"".  You must click on the down arrow next to the policy to see that it is only eilgible for refund or return if damaged or defective."
This one Not Accurate!  See my Review.  Wanted an exchange.,1,"This one Not accurate!  More than half the time the SantaMedical pulse oximeter I received starts and continues reading my heart rate in the low 30s.  Sometime it will finally get up to the 60's-70's.  While my ZacUrate oximeter always starts and stays in the 60's and 70s.  I wanted to return this SM PO for an exchange, but just missed the return deadline.  It was recommended by my EMT."
Broken product,1,Product doesn't shutoff automatically it keep reading nothing.
junk,1,"Got this over a month ago and it eats batteries. Very inaccurate, the readings are erratic"
The display would not even come on.,1,"The red light came on, but never got a digital reading. Sent back."
Failure,1,Product stopped functioning within 30 days. Would not recommend to anyone.
NO WARRANTY NOT RETURNABLE,1,Bad product out of the box no warranty you cannot return it.DO NOT BUY
Scam,1,Scam
Doesn’t work,1,Used on my clinic floor and was way off on vitals
Broke in a month,1,It broke
"Not accurate, must be defective.",1,"Item was not accurate at all, for any reading. You get what you pay for here."
This did not work at all,1,I bought it for back up so I didn't even put the batteries in it until I needed it yesterday.  It flat does not work and is past return.
Don’t buy junk,1,It broke 3rd time I used it
Used once and it stopped working,1,It stopped working after one use.  Too late to return
This product stopped working in 20 days and is not eligible for return according to Amazon.,1,this product stopped working in 20 days and is not eligible for return.  Don't buy.
Inaccurate,1,Totally inaccurate can only show 98 or 99 percent whether you are dying or not. Checked against real readings of 79 to 100. Screen is also smaller than some.
does not work right,1,I am going to send it back it is junk I wasted my time and money this isn't the first time I have been sent poor quality products
It quit working after two months. Barely used.,1,It was great while it worked but a few months is a short time for it to die.  Changed batteries and it was never dropped.  Just not worth the money for such a short time of use☹️
May be eazy to read but it's not accurate,1,I use pulse ox's a lot for breathing exercises and self monitoring and these are almost worthless.  I bought two of them and they both read high at 99% almost all the time.  Try a different brand....
Cannot warranty my product!,1,Took this pic after opening my Amazon box to find that the box was somewhat broken... I am not able to warranty this product because the QR code is gone.... the product works but I was somewhat worried I order through Amazon all the time and never had this happen...
Not a good buy,1,Inacurrate most of the time. Not sturdy. Turns off randomly
NOT ACCURATE AT ALL!!!,1,"Not reading accurate,every time different reading,do not recomend!"
Not Accurate/Low Quality,1,"Very low quality. I had a Walmart brand pulse ox that cost me 40 dollars. It broke, so I choose this one. Walmarts pulse ox was ok the build was solid. This is a cheap model. Floats way too much on finger, the hinges feel like a cheap clipped on close pin. Also, Walmarts brand seemed to maintain more accurate readings, instead of varying numbers."
Pulse/o2,1,The back cover won't stay on.
Piece of Junk,1,"Don't buy this.  First use: the battery cover would not close and ""the item isn't eligible for return."""
Don’t buy,1,Stopped working after 2 weeks. Sent back.
"does not give consistent, accurate readings on any level!",1,This was no where as good as previous monitor purchases - gives totally inaccurate readings to the point of I would have to be dead or stroked out if they were anywhere near correct
Reading Is not Accurate,1,"The reading is shown for pencil and other non living things when you tap on them,"
Didn’t work right out of the box,1,This product didn’t work right out of the box. I thought maybe it was the batteries so I put some new Duracell’s in it and still would not turn on. I got a refund but I really needed it so this was a bit annoying.
Non-returnable!,1,This item is non-returnable. I received mine in damaged condition and now I’m out the purchase price.
Don't waste your money.,1,Very cheaply made. Not very sturdy. Returned
Not good,1,I bought this to use at work. It’s horrible and falling apart after only 2 weeks of use and it wasn’t even used as much because it wasn’t working. Horrible product
Cheap,1,Cheap.  poorly made. Takes forever to get a reading.
Not a fast reading,1,"I bought this to use with pediatric pts, it takes too long and then they start fidgeting and it becomes impossible"
Devuelto,1,Su estructura estaba algo suelta y la lectura que daba no me daba confianza.
Isn’t accurate,1,This thing isn’t accurate
Great product,1,We love the Gurin Oximeter. Easy to use and very accurate. We were also pleasantly surprise receiving the product within 3 days. We thought that we would have to wait for at least a month.
it does not work,1,"What I don't like about it is that it does not work.  I am unable to get a reading on it.  The lights come on and then I get a ""bye-bye"" message.  VERY disappointed as I am on oxygen and need to keep tabs on my 02 sats."
Broke after a week,1,Broke after a week
Erratic and unreliable,1,"Readings are erratic and unreliable.  Instructions say to not use this device for any kind of healthcare related use.  If you want usable readings, buy something else."
Not worth the money,1,Came broke screen to small and not worth the money
Not Accurate,1,"I get a different reading on different fingers when using...Does not help in finding an accurate heartbeat.,."
Satisfied until it broke,1,Worked perfectly until it randomly died on me. Waste of money. Didn’t even have it for a week
Cheap plastic feel,1,"Nice color display but the plastic construction feels very cheap and doesn’t seem like it will withstand a drop on hard floor, (not gonna test it out)."
Inaccurate,1,Not sure why it had such high ratings. It is highly inaccurate. Waste of money.
Did not work,1,Upon opening- it did not work- changed the batteries- still not working - piece of junk
Didnt work,1,Product would qui working while in use and batteries had to be changed every 2days. I was very disappointed. I do have to say that Amazon made it easy for me to return the item
Bad,1,Don't waste your money
Eh...,1,Takes forever to register and often very inaccurate
Stop working after second use,1,Stop working after the second use. Tried to return it and Amazon told me the item wasn’t eligible for returns. I lost my money.
Junk,1,It's not accurate. Very slow to give iffy readings.
Not work,1,Once placed on finger it doesn’t read
About to fall apart right out of the box.,1,It works well but it won’t last long.  VERY CHEAPLY MADE!  Pulls apart at hinge and flops side to side.  I still think pieces are missing.
Defective. Doesn’t work.,1,I ordered it to check my blood oxygen saturation rate. It worked once and then stopped. The lights all come on but it doesn’t register a reading. Defective. Don’t recommend.
Worst pulse ox,1,Reading says 99 which i have not had a reading of 99 in years.  Cheaply made with the springs holding  the top and bottom together are weak.  Small  visual reading
Not accurate at all.,1,Not accurate at allNot accurate at all
Accurate readings,1,I am a nurse. And the measurements are not always right
Do not buy. Cheap and breaks easily . Not accurate either .,1,Breaks easily
Piece of junk.,1,Returning it.  Looks and works like it came from dollar tree.  Would not even stay on my finger.
Hard to read,1,Hard to read  Regret purchase
Not accurate customer service lousy,1,"Not accurate, don’t buy"
Not Accurate,1,Not Accurate
Actual accuracy is important for instant results,2,"After receiving this SANTAMEDICAL pulse/oxygen meter. I read the actual specifications that were in the Operation Manual.The accuracy is listed as being  PLUS or MINUS 3% for SpO2, this latitude in accuracy could lead to misleading conclusions.The meter should therfore be used only for reading trends.Daily readings should be recorded and the trend if any noted before coming to conclusions regarding any individual measurement.If you are not sure or are in doubt, have the readings confirmed by having your SpO2 levels and heart rate measured on a medically approved pulse/oxygen meter.I bought this to measure my and my wife's SpO2, if we started to have indications of Covid19  infection."
Very slow to read,2,"Ordered this pulse ox for my grandparents mainly because it had a waveform which indicates accuracy of reading. It looked similar to the Lpow version which i already owned, but was arriving sooner so i gave this one a shot.  Should have waited the extra day or two for the lpow.  This puls ox read very slowly on multiple people (like 2-3 minutes to get a reading) and even gave a few reading which were very inaccurate despite the waveform. Buy the Lpow. It works almost instantly just like what we use in the hospital, and the waveform is accurate."
Just OK,2,"This Pulse Oximeter has me scratching my head, because I don't think it is very accurate.  I found that the heart-rate monitor is totally unreliable, especially after exercise.  That makes me question the O2 accuracy as well.Just today, after a bike ride, mine jumped around from 188 bpm, down to 49 bmp, up to 163 bpm, and then down to 115 bpm over a 3 min period.  I resorted to a blood pressure monitor to calculate my heart rate, which was actually 89 bpm."
"Works but leaves a lot to be desired, not recommended",2,"I had a previous sensor that loved, but I lost it and it was no longer available on Amazon for a replacement so I bought these. Overall they seem to work but I'm not impressed...For reference: I bought two of these and my observations of both have been identical. The price point on my old unit and these was very similar.1. They are far more bulky than others I have has in the past.2. They are not as sturdy, and the hinge mechanism works but feels flimsy and doesn't stay aligned so I worry about it breaking soon.3. The battery compartment cover is barely held closed by the detent and comes off easily, somes even just bumping it. Worse, the battery compartment covers the entire back of the unit including the corner edges of the sides, so it is nearly impossibly to avoid and pops off all the time. It is also very difficult to remove the device from your finger without the battery door popping loose.4. The display area is much smaller than expected for the size of the unit. I later found my old unit and it has a slimmer design with a proportionally bigger display.5. The display is fixed in one orientation; it does not allow you to rotate it (e.g. for self-use vs for use on someone else).6. My older unit included settings and options for alarms, display settings, etc. These offer none of that (as far as I can tell).Overall they seem to work but I'm not impressed and am considering returning them. I recommend looking for a different model."
Low quality,2,"I regret buying this pulse oximeter but it's not worth my time to return it.  A number of red flags.  We had a decent unit that we gave to a relative when he contracted COVID-19, and figured we would just get another one for ourselves.  Since the local pharmacy where we got our previous one from was out of them, we ordered this one online.- Build quality of this unit is really cheap.  It wobbles and fits together poorly.  When putting it on your finger you have to avoid holding it a certain  way or the battery cover pops off.- It comes with a lanyard, as many of them do.  However, I DARE you to try to get it on.  The tiny holes to slip it through do not allow it to make the turn after getting it through the first hole, and both of us tried repeatedly and failed to get it done.  We're both capable people, and can thread a needle or even a fishhook, but not this.  It's no wonder why unlike our previous unit, this one comes shipped loose.- Not sure about the accuracy.  O2 level seems consistently a bit high +2% compared to all the others we have used (my wife is a nurse).  But close enough.- Distracting display with unnecessary clutter on the screen.- Tiny multi-language instruction manual, need magnification to read it, but it is what it is.Bottom line: It works, but feels and looks cheap.  We will likely give this one away and get a decent one elsewhere locally."
It started off Good and became unstable after 30 days,2,"When I received this device it worked very well and very quickly for about two weeks.  After that time it started to take up to 60 seconds to recognize a finger and in fact often just turned off because it would not recognize the finger.  This happens even when I change fingers.  Further, many times when it finally does recognize a finger after about two to three minutes and after trying three to four different fingers it would give a reading of 85% or lower only to adjust up to 99% with another finger and then back to 99% when the first finger was used.  This problem has become more and more of a problem and I am only at 35 days.  I would return, but since it worked well at first I thought it would be good and am now outside the return window.  They said it came with a lifetime limited warranty, but cannot contact anyone and Amazon washed their hands when I sent them a note.  I would just say, Buyer beware if you plan on buying it and if you are good with a two to three week unit then you should be fine."
Disappointed,2,"While using this oximeter, during the time it is needed most, it will not show results, it just keeps running till it shuts itself off! I am so disappointed in this meter! Will a different one work better? I don't know! But we need this to work while the episode is happening! Sorry you can't put it on and just leave it all day!"
DEFECTIVE,2,"The product is defective. The battery cover does not click in and is loose.  This happens whether or not the batteries are in or out so clearly it will fall off any day now,  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Allegedly got the best one from the Amazon reviews.  It looks like this is a newer model.  Maybe they need to revert back to the older model."
Flimsy / cheaply made -- does not feel worth the money,2,"I bought this yesterday. It arrived in a nice-looking box, but that's where nice things end. The product build quality is flimsy, and it does not feel solid at all. Basically a cheap 'no brand' item appears to be rebranded as Santamedical. When you put finger in it takes a while to recognize and stabilize the reading -- I suspect this is due to weak spring action (again the cheaply made build shows!). The display oled is beautiful, but what's the point if the reading is taking forever and the product is sub-par! Finally, inserting the lanyard is more than painful because the holes are super tiny, and when I managed to do it after 10 minutes of effort, the plastic joints (upper/lower parts) gave way and the lanyard came off the unit. What a shame! This is going back!"
Terrible as a primary and a backup,2,I’ve used this on multiple patients where the probe will time out without a single read or the probe will give me a single inaccurate result which won’t adjust. It will only work on me and at times it takes a good solid 45 seconds to a minute to produce a result. I keep it in my uninform pocket as a back up incase the spO2 on my Lifepak 15 acts up again and it has failed me multiple times. Look elsewhere!

Never again,2,"I bought this because we had Covid and I wanted to monitor our O2 and pulse. Mine consistently showed my O2 levels in the low 90's unless I took deep, deep breaths. My pulse, however, was consistently in the high 90's -mid 100's.  After 5 weeks, it was still the same so I was concerned and went to the dr. My O2 was 98 and my pulse was in the 70's, even after I got up and walked around. Not happy at all!You can't read it well but the first picture shows the O2 at 91 and the pulse reading 106!"
Worked Great…. For 4 weeks,2,"Read well and really helped us better monitor my father in laws O2. But 4 weeks later it just quit working. Like died out of nowhere quit working. His O2 drops in the 60’s while walking. So it’s kind of a big deal if we can’t monitor it, especially when it dies out of nowhere at 2am. Causing us to be on edge until Walmart opened to purchase another. If you don’t need this for a medical issue or reliability sure it’s $14, otherwise save your money and buy a more dependable product."
I cannot attach the lanyard...,2,The product seems to work fine although the results display are very small. Also. I am disabled and there is no way I can attach the lanyard (a must for me) I have had another meter that the lanyard was easy to attach. I’m afraid this one is going back and I’ll have to buy a different one unless they can send me one with the lanyard already attached. Poor design detail.
Not accurate or sturdy build...,2,I bought this for my parents I'm comparing to another brand I purched off Amazon but this device has such a poor build quality...everything from the plastic to the spring hinge just look like it won't last one small drop..it works ok if you have normal size fingers but it will give you about 30 seconds of wrong readings before it's close to what looks normal.  My dad has large hands and thick figures and it would just not even read his vitals. The measuring device wasn't strong enough to detect his oxygen or pulse...it was just blank...I would pass on this...not sure why it's amazon choice
Not that accurate,2,I had an opportunity to take this meter with me to two seperate doctor's appointments.I measured this meter against their meter. Readings were off by 2 to 4% on Oxygen.Pulse was close.On occasion I would get constant readings after 40 or more seconds on my finger.Santamedical does get good reviews which is why I purchased it.Thanks to Prime I sent it back. Maybe I just got a bad unit.
"Alleged one page manual requires magnifying glass, no useful info.  Display PI% unexplained.",2,It starts with saturation at 99% then drops to the actual rating.  Seems to work best in a dark area.  Manual is a single page with no explanation of the actual display - for example PI% is displayed but not explained.  Paper is bunch of irrelevant stuff from a user standpoint.  Need a strong magnifying glass to read it.  Based on the above I would say this unit is over priced.
"At Best, This Is So-So.",2,"The display has small, jagged digits which are hard to read. There's no provision to change the direction the display is oriented to. Threading the lanyard through the tiny holes is an exercise for magicians. I eventually used a shop magnifier to help. The lanyard itself is slightly short and a bit too wide but otherwise functional.On the other hand, the unit is light weight and easy to use. The reading matches that of my other, better unit.There have got to be better units out there and it's worth paying a bit more for one. Keep looking."
No solid reading.,2,"The SpO2 number kept changing drastically every couple seconds. Tried it on several people, but it was impossible to get a solid read. It would go from 76%, to 95%, to 90% to 99% to 93% in ten seconds. Certainly not a reliable device. Returning the same day it arrived."
what a disappointment,2,After researching some brands I settled on this one to replace my depleted Inova. I was sorry to see my Inova go. To start this was easy to operate right away - but then whoa. The readings bounced all over the place - up down with no consistency. Very disappointing. Sent it back.
Poorly made product,2,"This item is very flimsy and poorly made. Unable to use the lanyard because the hole  to thread it through is not all the way through. When the device is opened to put your finger in, it is very shaky and you have to manually close it on the finger. Shoddy workmanship. Don't buy this item"
Unreliable,2,"I normally don’t write reviews but thought I should warn the public. The first issue I have is I rarely get any data on the screen when I use it. I’ve used multiple fingers and it feels like I won a game whenever I see actual “numbers”.  Second issue, if I do get data , I’ll get unreliable numbers as seen in picture. I’m not a rabbit...."
Extremely flimsy,2,A lot of fluctuations in the readings. Not well made. Broke easily.
"Display Scratched/Scuffed, Feels Cheaply Made",2,"This pulse ox came with a case, 2 AAA batteries, lanyard, manual, & a registration card. Product box appeared sealed but it has scuff/scratch marks on the display of the pulse oximeter. Was this used?? It feels light in the hands (like a cheaply made plastic toy) even with the batteries installed, hinges felt like it was going to fall apart. I wasn't expecting it to be 'heavy' but I prefer the weight of a sturdy/well made pulse ox. I can't say if it operates as it should as I plan to return this item if it's not too much of a hassle."
Definitely don’t recommend,2,"The readings seem to be accurate and easy to read but I’m unsatisfied with the quality of the pulse ox. It appears to be made of cheap flimsy plastic and the hinges aren’t tight, making the two parts slide around when opening it."
varies,2,It takes a long time for info to come on screen and then the figures bounce up and down i.e. O2 will show 99 then drop to 92 then jump up to 96.  Not consistant.
Poorly  put together  Feels like it will fall apart.,2,This monitor feels like it will fall apart.  I'm not sure how accurate it is because of this. I have used several that have by far sturdier than this one.  I don't expect it to last long.
There are much better oximeters than this one.,2,"If you need an oximeter to use at home, this one is fine. If you plan on using this daily at work just know the battery cover falls off in your pocket….and that just sucks."
Trash,2,Two months and this thing is trashed.  Falling apart.  Works when it wants to.  Can't trust the accuracy.
Disappointed,2,"What I like it's compact and have its own carrying case,what I don't like its feel flimsy in my hand the no on display is small"
Way off,2,I was very happy with this until I checked the readings with my Dr.'s office. The readings were very different from my Dr.'s office readings.
NOT Accurate,2,The meter displays  2-3 higher than the correct value. Compared to known accurate meters. I would not purchase this Oximeter again.
Breaks,2,"Product works, but…The battery  door falls off (used black electrician tape for that)The lanyard was way too short (used my own)The lanyard opening located where two pieces of plastic met, and lanyard came out (used Gorilla Glue)So, aside from the readings, it was a hot mess.No recommended."
Junk,2,Takes FOREVER to get pulse and oxygen level readings. If you want to wait several minutes this is the product for you.
10-Apr,2,Doesn’t pick up reading for 5 minutes sometimes. Cannot use this at work.
inaccurate result,2,every time I used will get a completely different result
Santamedical Dual Color OLED Oximeter,2,Had to return it because the sensor numbers were so erratic and unreliable.
Very flimsy.,2,"Spring was very loose & it takes some time before receiving your reading. I’ve had better pulse oximeter from Santa Medical, but this one isn’t it!"
Wildly varying readings,2,Results varied wildly from one minute to the next. I guess I could be using it wrong…I put my finger in it and laid it on a table…but the varying readings imply to me it’s just unreliable.
Returned! doesn't work on children!,2,"Hi, I bought two oxymeters from Amazon, this one and another one that was way cheaper(Zacurate). This one does not read anything at all when put on my kids fingures( they are 11 and 14, so not super small). Also this one supposed to arrive faster, which it didn't. So I returned this one"
Okay for at home. Don't buy this if you need it for your job.,2,I'm an EMT and when I put this on someone's finger it tries to tell mere their pulse ox is 35. Their not saturating at 35 its just not reading right. I've had a few instances where this thing will jump in number or drop in number seemingly randomly. I don't recommend this to Healthcare workers.
Cheaply made,2,Cheaply made
Not happy,2,Disappointed....too loose to fit get different readings...would not buy again...looking for a different brand
Inaccurate,2,"The device consistently measures 2 numbers less than the doctor's office pulse ops, and less than other devices I own. Other than that it is quick. Just know that you must add 2 to whatever the reading you register for this device."
Simple and accurate,2,"I love this pulse oxygen device.  It comes with batteries, it is very simple to use. It is like the devices used in medical settings.  It appears to be accurate. I would suggest using it when you are well and writing KY down your oxygen level. Then remeasure routinely and when you are sick."
Needs to be more accurate,2,Inconsistent readings.  Can vary by 5 percent. Don't recommend
Don’t recommend,2,It’s very easy to read but it jumps all over the place! One second it said my pulse was 226 and a couple seconds later 41. My pulse is actually 88. The oxygen reading jumps from 99 to 83! I definitely don’t trust this.
Usable but will not sure how long this product will last,2,The product is flemsy.  When I pinch it.open it is not a sturdy product.  Seems loose and not well made.
Not accurate,2,It always read at 99 - not accurate.
Not accurate,2,I just used this and it said I was 92% oxygen with 103 bpm. I immediately did it right after and it said 99% oxygen with 56 bpm. I think I’d be dead with that slow of heart rate (I put my hand on my pulse and it was beating way faster). Very in accurate.
"Easy to use, inaccurate pulse rate readings half the time",2,Easy to use.Inaccurate pulse rate readings half the time.Instructions are poorly written and hard to follow.Would not recommend.
Inconsistent,2,This is alright for day to day use.
Not accurate,2,Its not that great. Takes forever to get numbers and most of the times there are not even accurate numbers. Not worth the money
Fragile!,2,It feels very fragile. I’m afraid it will break on any use. The back lid from the batteries keep falling all the time. I don’t recommend it
can't always get a reading,2,We cannot always get a reading.  For sure does not give a reading within 10 seconds as description states.  Sometimes we just give up waiting for results.  Not adequate for what it needs used for.
defective product :(,2,Product defective
Not something a novice user would understand.,2,I tried many different angles with my finger & sometimes it read & sometimes it didn’t.  I tried to replicate my finger angle when it did read & it gave a different number.  I didn’t understand what was normal & what was not.
Evidently Very Fragile,2,My husband dropped it on our hardwood floor and it stopped working. Just dead. Can't imagine that the electronics couldn't withstand a 3' drop without breaking.
Didn’t give accurate oxygen level.,2,The Blood/Oxygen level was not accurate.
A must have,2,"Great product, very accurate."
very slow,2,"Took forever to get a reading, and did not seem very accurate"
Oximeter,2,It’s loose whenever we use it we have to hold in the bottom part . It’s just too much work to return since this covid affects everything. The UPS nearby are close
IFFY,2,I HAD TO USE DIFFERENT FINGERS  TO GET A READING
Quality,2,It’s very loose fitting and takes awhile to show the reading. If you don’t hold it in place it will slip off the finger.
this oxi is not accurate and give wrong results,2,needs a better oxymeter needs to return it for refunds and get an accurate one
It’s very slow and you have to be patient to get an accurate reading.  The batteries run out fast,2,It’s not accurate at first. It runs very slow to get a reading.
weak,2,not as fast reading as i need
The back falls off,2,"When you pick it up the back falls off , where the batteries go."
Does not work well,2,Product is unreliable. Doesn’t work right
Get a magnifying glass,2,The print is very small
no good,2,no good
The battery cover immediately fell off and no longer locked in to place.,2,Read above statement
Good product,2,Easy to read display.
nada,2,no me gusto  muy lento
This Oximeter is Finicky,2,"I purchased this oximeter as my current one from another brand is wearing out and I like to have a backup. This oximeter is not the worst that I have tried, but the time and level of stillness it takes to get an accurate reading is longer than it takes with other meters, and sometimes it fails to get an accurate reading at all unless I take it off and on several times. While this meter technically works, at least some of the time, the quality is lower than ones I have owned in the past and currently. I do enjoy the display, but I wish it was more consistent."
not always accurate,2,"this device has given me pulse readings in the 30s-40s, and i even got one at 180, yet i'm still here. it's more accurate the second time.i would not recommend this one.the ZacVrate is much more accurate. i've matched it with the hospital's devices."
NOT accurate,2,"It’s not accurate. Will immediately read one number super high (PR 200) then 10 seconds later show a number much lower number (54). This happens often enough that I do not trust any of its readings.Also, the company is offering free gifts for 5 star reviews. So, I trust their 5 star rating as much as I trust the readings on this device.."
Product is not of good quality!,2,I received my item today. It's very wobbly not well put together nothing like the quality of the one my nurses use.
NOT durable at all!,2,I work as an EMT in a very busy city and the back piece fell off the very first day I used it. Now it has scotch tape on the back of it and it just feels very flimsy. Durability is awful. Would NOT recommend.
Cheap and flimsy,2,Arrived broken. One side was lifting out of its housing. Was flimsy and junky.
Easy to use pulse ox,2,"Easy to use but doesn't seem to made well, used it 2 days at springs are loose already."
Cmt,2,"Don’t waste your money, this o2 reader is hardly ever accurate and takes forever to read. I do not recommend"
O2 portion is off,2,Reading are not accurate
feel fit,2,did not like fit really loose
Skip it!,3,"Very small screen, very poor quality made pulse ox! I've had Pulse Ox from SantaMedical before and i loved it which is why i bought another after i lost the first one. The previous model i bought was a very good quality and lasted for years. So i cane to Amazon and search from the same brand but this time this particular model is just horrible. The way it opens and closes when you put on your finger is weird and it makes weird clicks. Its physical appearance is poor quality made. Very disappointed, i'll give it a 3 star only because the previous model i had from Santa Medical was great. Skip this model and buy something else!!!"

Generally gave higher blood oxygen readings then the other three units I tested,3,"Of the four oximeters I tested multiple times, three generally gave the same readings while the SantaMedical oximeter generally gave readings 2-4 points higher than the other three.Interestingly, the LPOW model A340, the Amemo A310, and the Amemo A320E are all manufactured by Shenzhen Aeon Technology Co., Ltd, located in China.My top choice, the Amemo A320E gave the same readings as the oximeter my doctor used during my appt on 3 Nov 2020. My doctor also noted this oximeter fit my finger better than the other three.Please see my data spreadsheet attached as a photo."
"Accurate, but terrible build quality.",3,"It shows pulse, oxygen level and perfusion index relatively accurately, but the oximeter build is very flimsy, has a bad hinge system which is partially exposed and is much less durable than comparable products in function and price."
Easy to use Oximeter,3,"I like that the oximeter is easy to use and appears accurate. The only reason that I didn't give this oximeter  higher marks is because the plastic plate that covers the batteries comes off easily. At least on my unit, the plate could secure itself better. It has popped off on me several times, and I've had to use scotch tape to secure, otherwise I would have lost it. Other than this, the unit is functional and does the job!"
"Seems to work fine, but. . .",3,"The instructions for attaching the lanyard don't make any sense. Pushing the small string into a blind hole doesn't do anything, or literally go anywhere. Good thing that this is for home use, so the lanyard isn't a big deal. But as a registered nurse, I've used all kinds of portable pulse oximeters that came with useable lanyards.Redesign needed, maybe?"
Inexpensive Oximeter and Easy to Use,3,"This oximeter is easy to set up and use.  It reports %oxygen saturation and pulse rate seemingly accurately.  It comes with a lanyard that allows one to keep the device connected around your neck.  I found it impossible to connect the lanyard to the oximeter.  The instructions were not clear, and the video supplied by the company was not informative or easy to follow.  I would rate this device higher, but the poor instructions on lanyard attachment caused me to give it a lower rating.  Also, there was a card in the box that offered me a free smart phone charger if I would write a review at the website given on the card.  When I typed in the website on my browser, I was directed to an non-secure website for Gurin products, and there was no place indicated on the site for where to submit the review."
It's OK but not great,3,"I had intended to buy a meter that would send readings to my cell phone, but somehow I ended up ordering this one, which does NOT send readings to my cell phone. I've got two others, and this one is not superior to those -- reasonably accurate, but not so much as a larger cuff-style blood pressure meter would be, and the pulse rate monitor is sometimes sluggish, giving readings that would make me dial 911 if I didn't know the fault was with the machine, not with my heart. It's probably better than some, but certainly worse than others. Spend a little more and get a better one -- That's my recommendation."
Good Unit but Too Bulky and Unstable to stay on finger.  And there are better ones.,3,"Pros:- Very bright screen- AccurateCons:- Does not stay on the finger easily if you move around at all, because:-- Too large and heavy-- Hinge is too loose (hinge must move a little to allow different sized fingers, but this one was too loose.I also bought this unit: Wellue 



   which has similar accuracy and bright screen, but also  stays on your finger well because it's lighter and has a tighter hinge.  Yes it's another Chinese-made unit, like they all are really, but just a better design.Note: I'm not a paid nor fake reviewer - I just like to research things well and let people know what I've found out.Background:I ordered three similar inexpecsive fingertip units from different companies to try and find a replacement for an expensive ($130-) Contec CMS50I wrist-worn unit that was very inaccurate and and had an unsably dim display.  I suspected that price might not reflect usability and I was right.  That pricey unit's primary benefits were connectivity via USB for data transfer."

review,3,the only reason I gave you 3 stars is because I didn't find out until I received the product it was made in china. I'm really trying NOT to buy products made in china. Other than that so far so good.
OLED Pulse Oximeter,3,"The oxygen sensor seems to work fine and reasonably accurate.  However, the pulse reader clearly isn't accurate.  Today it said my pulse was 241 (I'm ok!).  I switched to my other hand, and it read at 51.  My watch said my pulse was 81."
Cutting back on quality,3,"This device looks good, and the price is obviously effective bait.  However, upon receipt two things are immediately apparent:  reduced quality of the ""housing"", and lack of selectable orientation for the readout.This is the first one I've seen that can be viewed from only one direction.The case it's in looks good but feels flimsy.For a few dollars more, get something worth having."
Often slow to read.  Display seems to have a low refresh rate,3,"I got this just as an added data point for any COVID concerns.  It works well enough, but about every third time we use it, it seems to take forever (1-2 minutes instead of 8-10 seconds) before it will give a reading.  While the display is nice and vibrant, it seems like it has a low refresh rate, almost like it flickers.still, for the price, I don't regret the purchase."
Not accurate,3,"I purchased a month ago to monitor my oxygen level due to having covid. The first week it fit whatever finger I chose to put it on and the readings were accurate as far as I know.However, now it does not fit properly on my finger. It is very loose fitting and the readings are definitely all over the place or do not register at all.It did not hold up. Would not recommend."
"Warranty QR is faulty, can't get lanyard attached.",3,"I bought this to replace an identical one that seems to have ""grown feet"".  While the unit works very well, the lanyard holes are SO small I had to pry the case open slightly to get the loop in.  That's -1 *.Then I went to use the QR code to register the unit and it keeps sending me to Google Messenger, with no alternative way to register it.  That cost the 2nd *."
The Meter,3,"I have been using this product for about a month or so, it appears to be ok. you should be able to adjust the viewing angle either vertical or horizontal for easier reading. i have had others and most have that adjustment. The other item i don't like is the way it sits on your finger, with the current adjustment if you set your hand on your lap the meter will fall off."
Small screen and crap lanyard holes,3,"The lanyard holes on this thing are a joke. They’re WAY too small to get the lanyard through, and no amount of twisting or squishing makes a difference. The plastic wire within the cord that inserts in the holes came through the cord, and now it really is impossible to get through. Also, the screen is a bit of a let down. The colors are vibrant but man is the screen SMALL. That is saying a lot because the device itself is slightly bulky. Even on sale I would not recommend this pulse oximeter."
Fits Loose,3,"This pulse ox fits loose on your finger. It will suddenly stop working, then start back up. Has done so repeatedly. I bought 2, opened one and will be returning them both. I really wish I could find one like the very first I bought, but it's no longer available anywhere. I had higher hopes for this one with it's ability to also register heart rate as a sinus rhythm."
Not as accurate,3,Not as accurate as I thought. I wounded up going to the hospital for Covid and they also have a finger oximeter and the reading was completely different than mine. I argued w/ them because that’s not what i was getting on mine so they went & got a different one & there’s were the same reading yet mine was off.
Pulse not very accurate! Oxygen not sure? Not recommended!,3,Pulse is not very accurate. My heart rate reads at 44-49bpm. The app on my iPhone is more accurate because I compared it to the hospital monitor when I was there for a few days. Oxygen reading bounces around too much so I am very skeptical about its accuracy! I am not happy with this product!
Oxygen monitor works great But....,3,"The oxygen sensor appears to be very accurate and shows instantaneous changes in oxygen level, however, the heart rate monitor does not show instantaneous changes in heart rate like my old Santa Medical oximeter did. This monitor shows one heart rate and calculates some percentage value that I don't quite understand."
"Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2)",3,"BEWARE! The PulseOx - Oxygen analyzer - is NOT accurate. I bought this to monitor a family member's oxygen level due to COVID. It is NOT accurate. The heart rate is accurate though. If you only need to monitor heart rate, this works well. Do not buy this if you need an accurate oxygen analysis."
Quit working after 2 months,3,"I had Covid so I bought this to keep an eye on my pulse rate and worked very well.. Took it out of the drawer two months later and it didn't work. Tried new batteries and still nothing.. I have not tried to get support yet, waiting on some fresh batteries to make sure.."
Doesn't last long,3,"I purchased this product despite the bad reviews it turns out that sometimes you should listen to what others say. This machine worked for about 4 days, I had to take the batteries out and put them back in to get a reading. After doing this a few times and replacing the batteries altogether it no longer reads after day 5. Don't waste your money or FSA/HSA money on this product. IT WILL NOT LAST!"
It's ok,3,I took it to our Dr's office to compare and Dr's showed 96% oxygen levels and when they tried this one it showed 98% so it's not as accurate as the Dr's.  Also you don't know when it's done because numbers just keep going up and down.  I would have preferred one that makes a notification sound when reading is completed.
The test results are accurate but the fabrication is low quality.,3,"The results match exactly that of the medical grade units at my doctor's off and the local hospital.  However, sometimes you have to reposition your finger in the unit a few times to get it to actually read your oxygen level.  The hinge also seems a bit flimsy but with good care and always storing it in the case when not in use, it's worth the relatively inexpensive price of $20."
quick shipping-- lanyard issue,3,"This oximeter was shipped and received promptly. However, the lanyard loop is small, and difficult to get into one of the two lanyard openings. Also, the lanyard openings on the oximeter are in the seam where 2 pieces come together. And, if a tug is given to snug up the lanyard loop, the seam opens and the lanyard loop comes out from the oximeter."
Accuracy,3,I did not like the fact that it is always-2 for the oxygen sensor. Is it even tells you in the manual. Compared it with other Devices and this one was always 2 to 3 points above what it really was.
Too slow.,3,"It takes too long to read. I purchased another years ago and I should have sent this one back, it was a backup but not much use to me. I would not recommend it, simply because it does not suit me."
"Basic unit, simple to use.  Accuracy is unknown?",3,"Pretty simple device.  Don't know how to determine if it's accurate or not.  I am not an expert on these devices.  I use it to get an ""idea"" of whether or not the levels are way off.  If I'm concerned, I go to the Dr.  Again just for a basic idea, it works"
Battery compartment,3,Loved it readings are great  an clear my only complaint  is the battery compartment the cover is loose won't stay on will fall off other than that it's a great prodict
It works.,3,"Pulse Fingertip , it’s ok , but it’s cheap made . Works great .But I don’t like how cheap it feels.But for the price I guess I can’t complain. Lol"
Not solidly built as others,3,The hinge feels very easily breakable and feels very easily broken  unlike the ones used at the doctors office.  It works well but be gentle with it.
Incorrect readings and cheaply made.,3,Cheap quality.  Does not close tightly on finger and readings are very  inaccurate.  Waste of money and return policy is nil.
Not real accurate,3,"This product wasn’t as good as I expected. I don’t know if it’s because I have acrylic nails or what, but I could never get a reading. I eventually stopped using it."
Eh,3,Sometimes it doesnt read at all and other times it takes a while for the numbers stabilize. Wouldnt trust in an emergency situation.
"Better than nothing, but not much.",3,These oximeters are very touchy. If your hands are cool they do not work at all. You have to wait for several minutes before they level out. Honestly the only thing good about these oximeters is the price. I bought 6 of them for stocking stuffers - not the hit I hoped they’d be in this Covid year.
Blood oxygen meter,3,Works well but the literature does not explain what all of the numbers are for and what is a normal range
Good Oximeter Buy Flimsy Hinge,3,"This is a basic oximeter and it is accurate, but the hinge is very flimsy.  I am surprised Santa Medical put out such a flimsy product.  You can generally trust the quality of Santa Medical, but this time they have disappointed me due to the poor hinge.  It almost feels like the two sides are going to fall apart when you insert your finger to take a reading.  For the price, it should be better made."
"If the inclusion of a lanyard appeals to you, look elsewhere.",3,"Measurements are  presented with rather small characters compared to previously owned devices..  Not possible to install the lanyard with ordinary sewing items.Used for routine monitoring.Slightly disappointed with the item, especially since we previously had a similar item by the same supplier."
Heart rate was out of wack !,3,"Okay , I really wanted to love this product ! I currently am a student and have been doing my clinical rotations . I have to use my pulse of on patients and this has inaccurate readings , especially for the heart rate on a patient. I am a bit disappointed with this product."
Not Accurate,3,For a general idea it’s fine but always 2-3 points above my doctors office 02 readings.
You are not going to know when the reading is complete.,3,"The product seems a little flimsy and I was expecting a beep to let me know if the reading is done. When using it, I am not sure if the reading is done or what. It says it takes  30 seconds but I guess you will have to time it, so I am disappointed in not having a feature to let me know when reading  is done."
Sometimes  works sometimes does not,3,Sometimes does not take a reading. You have to try 2-3 times to get a reading
Not as good as old Santa Medical models,3,"This new model is not as easy to use, not as accurate and not as easy to read as older models. It is not an improvement at all. Buy the older Santa Medical oximeter models instead, they are great."
Cheap,3,"Buy the red/white one not this never works when you want it to, even after battery change"
Limited time,3,Great if you need it to turn off automatically but useless if you want to monitor more than a few seconds.
Not too bad,3,"Product is easy to read and came with batteries, lanyard and nice carrying case. Seems to be somewhat accurate. A tad flimsy in quality."
Except as indicated am satisfied. Will know more after talking with manufacturer.,3,From time to time I do not get a reading until I remove and reinsert a finger as often as three times. I plan to contact the manufacturer. My health issue makes quick accurate reading vital.As to accuracy. I recently compared a reading with the reading on one used by a physician and the readings were identical
Meh,3,"I returned it, the oxygen monitor was jumping all over the place and now's not the time for an inaccurate reading.  The pulse rate seemed to be accurate"
Works,3,Feels cheap but it is cheap. I compared it to our $1000+ machine at work and it’s right in the same readings with it. I did however manage to loose the backing for the batteries since it comes off easily. Would recommend for a cheap one but I plan to get a better one.
It doesn’t give a reading after waiting a long time.,3,"I want to return this product because it takes forever to get a reading and many times, after waiting for it to register, it then turns off. I plan to order a different one."
"To flat, needs finger groove but works",3,To flat / other was better
Accuracy is poor,3,Not very accurate.  Got different readings within 2-3 minutes
Soso,3,Just ok
Not immediately accurate,3,This is not an immediate accurate device. It takes about a minute of wearing before pulse is correct.  Thus it would be a minute to get oxygenation correct. Not good if you need an immediate read
Works great at first,3,"Initially, this was fast, accurate, and very easy to use and read however this device quickly breaks down with frequent use.  As of this morning, it will not read at all, just lights up.  Very disappointed because it had great reviews."
not aways accurate,3,not always accurate.
Sub-par monitor,3,Sometimes it isn't accurate with reading or doesn't read at all.
It does the job slowly,3,Very slow to read.
Works for what I needed but not perfect.,3,Oxygen meter is spot on but the Heart Rate not so much.
Not as accurate.,3,Like how easy it is to read but is not as accurate as my older one.
Bad buy for my use,3,Not good for the hospital users
"It works fine, but…",3,The back holding the batteries doesn’t close tightly. It falls off.
Product Review,3,Could be a bit more durable.
Acceptable,3,Instruction manual pictures poor. Can not insert Lanyard
Erratic readings,3,This oximeter was giving erratic readings. I have returned it back
Not so accuracy,3,"Not so accuracy, considered to return."
maybe.,3,It always seems to read at 99 which I don't think is correct.
Take the reviews with a heavy grain of salt,3,"This came with an offer of a free charger in exchange for a review. So, take all the positive reviews with a grain of salt.That said, the product seems very nice and works as intended. But I don't have another oximeter to verify its accuracy."
Sensitivity sucks,3,The sensitivity could be better and the battery life doesn't last long.
Landyard,3,Landyar was imposiple to attach!
calidad,3,muy frajil
inconsistent readings,3,reading would change every time i took a reading. not so sure about reliability
Fragile,3,"It feels very cheap a fragile at hand, like it will break when I grab it… Don’t like it."
Will not shut off on its own after each use!,3,"This oximeter will not shut down on its own after 10 minutes, let alone 10 seconds. So in order to save the batteries, I have to pull them out everytime and reload every time I want to use it!"
Pulse oximeter,3,This pulse oximeter is very sensitive like ones at the doctors office.  Very easy to use though.
"Accuracy, easy to use, and easy to read",3,"It worked great for about 2 weeks then it got real slow and sometimes you have to turn your finger sideways to get a reading at all,it also cuts off in the middle of it taking your oxygen."
Seems to be accurate but cheaply built,3,"The meter is very cheaply built, I really don't expect it to last too long."
"Frequently refuses to give a reading at all.  When it does work, the numbers look fine.",3,"Frequently refuses to give a reading at all.  When it does work, the numbers look fine."
It takes a while before it reads,3,It takes a while to get results. I use it in the hose as my personal equipment.
Quality,3,No comments
Ok,3,Not sure of accuracy read differently on different hand
Doesn't work with long fingernails,3,Works good for my husband but won't read with my long fingernails
accurate but feels like will break any moments,3,"product made very cheap, does not hug finger all the way."
Accuracy,3,I am not sure how accurate the pulse ox reading is.  The heartrate reading compares with other devices we have here.
poor instructions,3,works ok.
"Accuracy ok,",3,Battery cover will not stay on..
Not worth the money!,3,Not durable! fell apart within a week
Works good. Good price.,3,Works good. Good price.
No comment,3,No comment
Average,3,Using it
"solid, works well",3,"The battery life seems good so far, I like the design of the display."
NA,3,NA
Unusable lanyard,3,Lanyard was impossible to use
o2,3,know clear
Inconsistent function,3,Really sad about this.I like the pulse oximeter but it only reads out about 75% of the time .I replaced the batteries thinking that possibly that was the issue .It was not.It is just not functional 100% of the time as it should be.It is accurate when it does work as I did do a comparison and this was accurate.Of coarse it is past its return date and the kinks could not be ironed out.Think I just got a lemon.
Ehhh,3,I bought two. I already have one of another brand that I love. But I decided to go on price.🤦🏻‍♀️ It works. Sometimes I don’t believe the readings based on my other one. They are also really flimsy.
Wouldn't order again,3,I'm a home care nurse so I've used many if these over 12 years. This product does seem to accurate 90% of the time when compared with manually taken pulse.The item itself feels very cheap and does not hold tightly to finger. Spring feels like it should be tighter.
Product great . Shipment not so much:(,3,The product itself is super easy to use . Plug in batteries and push start and it’s ready to go! The only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that the box the device came in was crushed.
On and off sometimes,3,It is easy to use and carry around but sometimes the reading doesn't seem accurate. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong. I'm following the instructions. I will have to see long term.
Oxygen levels questionable?,3,"Easy to use, but will only work on my last 3 fingers on each hand, my index fingers are too big to get an accurate reading. Always seems to be off by 1 to 2 percent, my readings should be 97 or 98 %, but most times are 95-96 on this device. once in a while my readings while be 97 or 98% but only if I recline and bring it up to heart level.Pulse seems to be fairly accurate"
Liviano,3,No me agrada su fragilidad.  No se ajusta con presion al dedo y eso pudiese variar la toma de presion de Oxigeno
Breaks Easily,3,"It is accurate, however it started to break with normal use. I ordered a different brand."
Not for outdoor use,3,Product is as described except for being able to see the readout in the sunlight. You certainly can not see it in the sunlight.
Easy to use,3,"Easy to use, not secure enough, it falls off"
accurate,4,"So far so good. I got this only a few days ago, but it is accurate because my o2 stats are the same at the hospital. I can bring up my stats by doing breathing exercise. If there is any thing that I would do to improve the rating is that the numbers are a little on the small side. Lucky for me I still have good eyesight, but wonder if this could be a little difficult for some one that has poor eyesight. I promise an update if there are any changes since this review. UPDATE: I promised an update I am still pleased with this product, I bought it in August of this year and it is still fine. I don't know if this is a long time for durability, but so far so good."
The best oximeter of several I tried,4,"The Santamedical pulse oximeter is well made, reliable , easy to use and works well. Its clearly the best of several I tried. I initially bought an Ankovo and it was a bit wiggly, hard to place the finger in exactly right, the readings and  were variable. I finally returned it after becoming frustrated using it for a few weeks. Then based on careful reading of reviews I bought both the Santamedical and Innovo Deluxe to try them out. The innovo was also hard to use because the readings are sideways along the length of the finger and it was not as solidly made as the Santamedical, so I returned that as well. The Santamedical was great. Well made, reliable, worked easily every time I put my finger in. If you are looking for home use pulse oximeter I would recommend this one."
Good for your first aid kit.,4,"Does the job, but is your standard pulse oximeter in this price range.It reads accurately. In terms of durability, if intended for daily use it will take being conscious of utilizing its case and using care in handling to make it last.If you are someone with poor circulation and have chronic respiratory issues you may struggle getting a good reading with all of the pulse oximeters in this price range.Purchased this for a first aid kit and it meets that need."
Can't speak to accuracy,4,"I bought this because I am just coming off of COVID and F-I-L suggested we keep track of our oxygen levels.  There needs to be better directions as another reviewer stated.  You have to go to other sources to determine what the levels should be.  Also, the numbers on our unit do not quit moving - perhaps that is how it's supposed to work -  but some additional direction would be appreciated.  I am not sure if you are supposed to go with the first numbers that display or wait 30 seconds and then read it? The biggest plus is that the unit is not uncomfortable to use, but I'm not sure we are using it correctly."
"Received quickly, seems to work as directed.",4,"Directions of use and assembly are not clear either from the words used or pictures.1.  Battery direction - very hard to see plus or minus and it would be easy to indicate in a picture where to look2.  Direction of finger - again would be easy show whether it’s palm up or palm down.  Or write it in a way that’s obvious.  I had to go on Youtube to be sure.3.  Turning it on - no instruction to do that.  Easy to figure out but why not include that.4.  When results are final - writing is misleading.  Picture looks like I’m waiting for the bar to stop moving.  I think you mean to say it’s done within 30 seconds.  So just say - results are final at 30 seconds-there is no beep or freezing of info.5.  Biggest is that there is no place to find out what the results mean.  What’s normal?  Again, I have to google and visit various sites to know what’s average.  And I’ll likely have to google each time as I’ll forget the next time I use it.  Why not include it in instructions?6.  Identify - what Sp02 means - say “oxygen level”.7.  Identify what PR means - say “pulse rate”.8.  Identify what pi means - I still can’t find out why this is important and what it means."
Checking Family During Pandemic,4,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients. I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level, as well as my family's, at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office. This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power. I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses. The unit has an added benefit of powering down after a few seconds of non-use so the batteries should last a long time."
Product good but instructions poor,4,"The oximeter is fine, but I wish the instructions were clearer and more detailed. Actually, I have a suspicion that the literature was meant for a different model.The directions say to put your finger in the clip, then loosen the clip, and the SpO2 value and PR value will be displayed on the screen. However, nothing appears on the screen unless the power button is pressed. And although the illustration shows a Power and Function Button, there’s no other reference to it in the instructions. Does it matter if the button is pressed before or after the finger is inserted in the device?I wish there was some information about perfusion index. My P.I. readings have been all over the place – from 0.2 to 11.5 – and I’d like to know if this is “normal” for an 81-year-old.Also, an illustration shows the tiny holes in the oximeter through which the lanyard is supposed to be threaded. Actually, the lanyard clips onto the carrying case. It’s much too wide fit through those tiny holes."
Didn't like my fingernails!,4,"This device worked beautifully with everyone else, but apparently my fingernails are very irregular in thickness and so it can't interpret the information it gets.  When I use it, it will show it's working, but for several minutes, it will show no results, and if it does they don't make sense (Oxy 85%, pulse 150, for example).  Then, after trying on several fingers, it may very quickly show an Oxy 96 % and pulse 62.  However, it's easy to use and read, and even shows the battery power level (very handy) .  Maybe in a few months, if my fingernails grow out smooth, It'll work for me.  If not for the problem, I'd give it 5 stars."
Accurate and Easy to Use,4,"Great Sp02 meter for medkit or aviation use.  Seems accurate and less finicky about positioning or finger selection than my other meters.My only con with this meter, compared to my others, is it is slightly larger and bulkier, and it seems slightly less robustly constructed.  My other meters have rubberized material over the exterior plastic, which makes them seem like they could take a drop or 2 and survive.  That said, I feel this is a great value for anyone needing an Sp02 meter.  The larger size is probably necessary to accommodate the 2x AAA batteries, which is a plus on its own, since finding coin cells that last more than a week these days is problematic."
Helpful Device That Could Save A Life,4,"This pulse oximeter is a tiny device that can tell you the oxygen saturation level in your bloodstream as well as your heart rate and strength of your pulse.  With the prevalence of Covid-19, knowing the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream can help you detect a potential problem before Covid-19 c would overwhelm your system. This advanced notice might even help to save your life. The only negative issue is that with everything being black, it was slightly difficult for me to attach the lanyard and insert the batteries properly. Also, the battery insertion instructions could have been a slight bit more detailed."

"Generally good, but the readings can be erratic...",4,"I like this in so many ways.  It's compact, easy to use, and it provides the necessary readings. However, I notice that sometimes the readings will jump around if I leave the device on my finger for, say, 15-30 seconds.  The oxygen reading can sometimes vary between 96-99 over 30 seconds, which doesn't seem to make much sense.  Do I like this?  Yes.  Do I think it's accurate?  Reasonably accurate - I feel it at least provides me pretty close readings, which I can accept."
"Kind of temp sensitive, but good overall",4,"I keep one of these in my pocket after some issues recently. Readings get kind of janky if it's cold (like, 60* or less) or if it's being jiggled (like in a moving car) but for the most part, it's pretty accurate. Long battery life as well, with a visible charge meter on the readout."
"Great display, Works great so far, Lanyard issues, Included bag is great",4,"Product seems good . It's very light and feels a bit flimsy but I think it should be good quality. Having case is great for safety for Oximeter.  Case size is perfect. Very good display. I could validate heart beats with BP monitor. Those match more or less. Having Oximeter is peace of mind during COVID.Had disappointment with lanyard. After so many attempts, I could not thread it. Looked at reviews and see many had same problem so I gave up on that.PS: Writing this review I am promised to get a small reward but  I am giving honest review based on my current impressions of the product at this time"
"Easy to use OLED Oximeter, just couldn't use it with lanyard",4,"I received the delivery and opened the box. Everything was packed very well. I removed the device, batteries, lanyard and directions. I installed the batteries checked the device out. Put it on my finger and it ran close to what my other oximeter's readings were. I then went to try to install the lanyard. I threaded the string through the holes and did the loop maneuver. I tried several times but it never worked. I liked that it came with a case but I took a star away because the lanyard kept coming off."
"It Works, and It's Quck",4,"Very easy to use, but I thought the manual (actually a sheet) was rendered in such small type that it was extremely difficult to read, and the images were so small that I couldn't tell which side of my finger should face the laser. The LED dial is very small, but it's surprisingly easy to read. I checked the accuracy of the data by trying the device on the opposite hand. Comforting to see how similar the readings were.This pulse oximeter is easy to use right out of the box. Yes, I recommend it."
It provides the information I need,4,"Most oximeters would not require a cute little storage bag for protection, so I don't know why they include one.  Another thing that I did not understand is  the ""perfusion index"" number.  I still do not know what is normal or average.  The only thing that I have found since the range is from 2% (low) to 20% (high).  But it does give fairly accurate numbers for blood oxygen and heart rate."
This is a sports oximeter,4,"This device is very easy to use...pop in the batteries, push the on button, open and place on finger.  Readings begin immediately.  In this day of COVID-19, I wanted something that would give me a range of normal for me.  This little oximeter does that for me.  The three stars on accuracy is because I don't have a second oximeter to compare with.We had ordered an oximeter from a different place and had all kinds of trouble.  This company was honest and even delivered ahead of their projected time."
Works well -- glad I purchased it but has two tiny misses,4,"Happy all around. Price it right. Does exactly what it's supposed to do and does it accurately.Only two tiny misses. The instructions don't say which finger to use (index or middle?).  Important as I notice readings are different (the middle finger has more positive results). Oximeter includes a handy lanyard; however, the holes to loop it through are the size of a pin head, making it IMPOSSIBLE to attach."
Nice Unit!,4,"This is a nice unit it comes with a carrying case and lanyard along with batteries. As far as accuracy I have to compare it with the one at work, I haven’t had a chance yet. The numbers are a little small for me to read easily and quickly, but that’s my eyes. This is good for home use or on the go when you need to monitor yourself or a family member. If accuracy is good then I would recommend this especially for the price point."
"Great product, but where’s the RESULTS CHART?!?",4,"It was easy to use- put in batteries, hit start button. That’s it! Clear read outs, but can’t find ANYTHING enclosed that states what the NUMBERS MEAN!! No chart, quick start, scanned website- WHERE ARE THE RESULTS LISTED?!?  That’s why I lowered the Review- hopefully someone will see this, and Contact/Rectify with a RESULTS GUIDE."
Just checking,4,"We bought this pulse oximeter after reading that people with c-19 infection may not be aware initially that their 02 level has dropped. Now we check our 02 regularly. The device works fast, shuts off automatically, not complicated at all. I have nothing to measure against to determine accuracy of 02 readings, but I do get the same pulse rates with this device and my blood pressure cuff. Little manual that comes with this device is just adequate."
Good for home use.,4,"The readout screen  is clear and easy to read. It seems accurate (it showed 95% resting on me rising to 100% when I hyperventilate) thats about the same as when I am at the doctors office. The pulse rate was right on the mark. At the price I paid, it was a great deal."
Worth the price,4,"I received the Oximeter in 2 days. It was packaged well. The device is extremely easy to use and appears to be accurate within 2%. The lanyard is difficult to feed through the holes in the device, I may have to get a needle and thread it through. Also parts of the instruction manual were not translated into correct English and are missing words. But the device is easy to use without instructions. Worth the price."
Readings seem consistent.,4,"The readings made by this Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter have been consistent for myself (98-99) and for other family members (usually 99).  We had no problem with varying finger sizes, although I am unsure of the fit to very large fingers.  None of us use nail polish, so we could not judge any effect from that. The unit is easy to use, except the display characters could be a little bigger.  If I get a chance to compare accuracy to a ""professional"" Oximeter, I will update this review."
a slam dunk for the price,4,"This is a very good oximeter, and good accuracy. It seems a little slow to display the readings and takes a moment to settle on values. I compared it to the one at my clinic as it was within one digit of the more expensive professional grade device. Mine read 97, while their oximeter read 98. I was very impressed."
Works fine,4,"I think this worked just fine. It was a little annoying trying to fit the lanyard in the holes. I didn't understand the instructions for it. You basically have to decide if you want it on the right side or the left. I was thinking it needs to thread all the way through from one side to the other.My oximeter does make a high pitch sound, and  not sure if that is normal  So will update if I need to."
cheap price,4,Seems to work ok but was disappointed that no protective cover on the display so it had a small scratch on it.  makes me wonder if item had been returned??? or refurbished???  seems to work correctly but I would be careful as it does not seem to be sturdy.  With all that the price was good considering this is still a hard to find device at a reasonable price.  I would recommend as long as you treat it gently.
A little slow,4,"I had a different brand before this one that gave the results faster.  This one is a little slow to wait for results, and the readout is kinda small.  I am going to look back in my Amazon orders and buy another of the one I had last time, which I gave to my dad to monitor his COPD oxygenation."
works fine,4,"It works as well as my old one.  The only downside is the ribbon used on the ""lanyard"" .  It connects to the container rather than the oximeter itself.  My old one had the lanyard attached to the oximeter itself and wasn't made from ribbon which probably won't be very longlasting."
Easy to use,4,"I like this little pulse oximeter, it is easy to read. The only thing that bothers me about it is that it jumps around a lot with its readings. This makes me wonder about the accuracy I guess. It will jump from 97% to 95% to 96% all within a few seconds... maybe this shows it is very sensitive? Not sure... but it is easy to read."
Instructions were not clear for some readings,4,"We like the ease of use. We were going through Covid and needed to know our oxygen levels daily.  I understood that reading, the pulse reading, but I never could find out in the instructions what the last lower reading meant in plain English.  The unit is excellent otherwise."
"Easy to use, easy to read",4,"We bought this to check our oxygen levels. It seems to do a very good job. We usually use a blood pressure cuff to check pulse. When my wife compared the pulse reading from the Pulse Oximeter to the reading on the blood pressure cuff, it was very similar. However, when I tried, the readings were considerably off. One time to high. Another time too low."
Great little accurate device.,4,"This one is more accurate than my last Pulse Ox.  I'm an EMT, and I compared it vs medical grade equipment and it worked great.  I like the pleth and PI, which many Pulse Ox devices don't show.  The OLED display is bright and crisp, I just wish it was a little bigger so the PI reading wasn't so small.  That is the trade off from OLED vs LED, the cheaper and less crisp LED displays are generally larger.Overall very pleased with and would recommend.  The carrying case (includes a belt loop on the back) and lanyard were also great additions."
Works on small people,4,"I purchased this for adults and children.  I purchased an Innovo product to compare and while it also performed as described, it did not work on my youngest child.  Happy to have something that will give me peace of mind when my loved ones are under the weather.  Also a neat product for testing my fitness/health performance as well!"
Pulse Oximeter,4,I am writing in response to your request for feedback on my recent purchase of a SantaMedical pulse oximeter.On a scale of 1-5I would give this item a solid 4.I purchase this item for personal use because of price which is affordable to all. I have been an EMT for 15 years and was familiar with other brands which I have compared for accuracy and find that it is a great value and is quite accurate. Yes the case is not as rugged as the professional pulse oximeters like used every day. But for personal use this is a Gem.
Just right,4,"This device is easy to set up and use. It reports %oxygen saturation and pulse rate on the face of it accurately. It comes with a cord that allows one to keep the device connected around your neck.It works great in that the results are instant, easy to read, and require only 2 x AAA battery power.I like the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses. It’s nice also that the power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time.The fine prints are hard to read I wish there is a video link tutorial on how to follow in a more user-friendly manner"
Quick and Easy to Use,4,I bought this because we wanted to be able to easily monitor our blood oxygen levels at home. We're very pleased with this oximeter. Battery installation was simple and the device is easy to use. It would have been nice to have a chart of typical values with the directions but I was able to find that data on the internet.
Love it!,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Easy to read, large enough numbers. Only one thing is I guess I expected it to stop once reading is completed. It continues to read but I guess that's a good thing. Overall, great product and price"
Takes accurate readings,4,These pulse oximeter does the job well. I didn't give 5 stars because it is a replacement for another meter I had lost. And that one was faster with larger numbers. But I thought I'd give this one a chance based on reviews and it does not disappoint.
Does the job well,4,Love the extra features that are not on the more simple model (pulse and oxygen saturation).  My mother was in complete heart block and only ran a heart rate of 27-34 bpm.  It was able to detect an oxygen saturation of 79% for her.  The graphic view is well worth the price of the device.  I would purchase this item again without hesitation.
A simple blood pressure monitor,4,"Bought this for my Dad. We currently have one of those blood pressure monitors for your shoulder and he hates having to take his sweater off especially during cold days just to check his cholesterol levels. Compared to the bigger monitors, this finger monitor's heart beat rate isn't as accurate so I'll have to dock a star out of that.Still overall it's a quick and easy product and my parents can use it to quickly check their blood pressure easily!~"
Accurate,4,"The unit was highly rated in the reviews of it. Turned out that it is a very handy, accurate device for very little money. The first one I bought was a different brand and did not work well. (too slow) (not accurate). Very happy with this one."
Covid19 safety net,4,Purchased this pulse oximeter as a safety net from covid19. I am caring for my husband who is predisposed to covid due to  pulmonary  issues.  An article from the New York times  which compiled an account of virus survivors recommended having it handy to measure the oxygen level of the patient. An independent research showed this brand as one of the top rated by professionals.
Non-Returnable,4,"This product is fine, but my wife liked the purple one from Zacurate more, so we wanted to return this one, only to find out this one is non-returnable, so I ended up with one for me as well as the one for her. That is why I gave four stars overall. Price is good and it is as easy to use as any other."
Wiles well consistently,4,"This is a excellent product and it works  most of the timeIt doesn’t like cold fingers!!I’ve tried a lot of these units and, unless you invest a lot of money into a forehead one, this one is a good choice"
"Works well, easy to read and operate",4,"The little pulse and oxygen meter is easy and convenient.  Just put a finger in and press the button. When you're done, take your finger out and it says ByeBye and shuts down.  Seems accurate but that's hard to tell for oxygen.  Pulse is extremely accurate. Helps with exercise monitoring."
Good device for the price,4,"Easy to use, arrived early. Simple & straightforward. Only fault I've seen is the first reading often shows heart rate ridiculously high, like 210bpm, so you have to give it 30 seconds to let it cycle again to get the real number. The blood oxygen reading has been inline with the Dr's ofc."
Good value,4,These seem to be very accurate and have good information.  My wife misplaced hers.  So I bought this for her.  It has readings close to the other one- which she found after I ordered this.
Very surprised how well this performs,4,I worked in health care 40 years. My pulse-oximeters cost the hospital $65 each and this one performs just as well. I purchased 2 previous one and sent them back. This one is a keeper.
Seems fine,4,"I use this because on airplanes, my SaO2 goes too low.  Although it seems to work okay, although it takes longer than others I have used to reach a normal number under the SaO2 but seems to be working."
Good,4,It was pretty easy to use but then you have to look at the instructions. I hate that you have to turn up button on to get it to work. It tells you to use it on a different finger than your first finger. It is a little bit difficult to read but not horrible. I kept it because it is good enough. The readability is the biggest issue other than that it's pretty good
Happy with this product,4,The information showing on the screen is visually  easy to read.  I do wish that the information that comes with it was in larger type.  Even with a magnifying glass it was hard to read.  I didn't know for sure if my information that showed on the screen was bad .. good.. or OK so I googled what the parameters should be. I'm happy to have this in my home as it could be very important to have
Great value.,4,So far so good.  Granted I've only had this product for a few hours it is easy to use>  My only complaint thus far is that the directions do not describe what the PI% means - although I did a quick Google search and figured it out.
"So far, so good",4,"I received my order quickly and efficiently. Product is working well so far, but two minor things would make it easier to set up/use out of the gate.1. The lanyard was difficult to connect to the meter. The holes were really small and the loop to feed through got caught.2. It would be nice to have a basic description in the user guide as to what all the acronyms on the meter mean for laypeople, and maybe even normal ranges."
If the device is accurate I would recommend it for anyone needing to monitor their O2 levels.,4,"I bought this product because I need to monitor my O2 level. When I use it it always reads in the upper 90s, when I visit my doctors their pulseoximeters almost always read in the upper 80s to low 90s. I’m not completely confident in the Santa Medical devise readings. It’s critical for me that the reading is as accurate as possible as I need to use oxygen through out the day and I’m concerned with using too much or not enough. There is also a possibility of CO2 poisoning from inhaling too much oxygen. I don’t know how to check it’s accuracy as there are no instructions for doing that."
Fast readings,4,"I ordered this unit to replace an old device.  I find it gives a much faster reading than my previous device.  Only downside is the mounting hole for the lanyard loop, too small and poorly located.  Other that the it's an excellent device."
Easy to use and good quality,4,The OLED screen is clear and easily read. Accuracy seems good but I haven't yet compared it to my doctors test unit. It is erratic when used on a finger with nail polish so users of nail polish should be aware of this otherwise excellent device.
It works good.,4,"I love it, it's pretty accurate for the most part and is easy to use, I gave 4 stars because it is very flimsy and looks like it is going to break any second. It hasn't broke yet but the quality could have been better for this price!"
APPEARS RELIABLESantamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter,4,Product is good compared to some other more expensive models.Customer support leave something to be desired. They do not followtheir own instructions/DIRECTIONS with regard to feedback on this product. In factthey said they cannot even find this review. AMAZING!
Works as advertised,4,Seems to give reasonable readings.  Can't check accuracy but is what was expected. Display is clear and easy to read.
Good Product,4,We ordered this to have on hand if anybody gets a respiratory illness. We did test it out to get baselines on our immediate family. Seems accurate from what we see. Happy to have one hand. Delivered quickly and good customer service follow up. Santa was a recommended brand in reviews although this model was not mentioned.
As promised,4,Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter seems to be accurate. I agree with other reviewers the grip could be a little stronger. The device is as expected and order arrived complete.
Nice screen,4,"Very nice screen. Seems accurate, but I have no way to prove that other than matching it to an older unit. Good enough for home use."
Worked great,4,I used this when I had COVID to check my oxygen levels and it worked accurately and perfectly
Works well,4,"Out of the box threw in some batteries and took readings within about 10 seconds. It's easy to read and straightforward to use. Feels a little fragile, so time will tell how well it holds up."
Takes a bit longer to acquire readings.,4,Accuracy is fairly decent; although I've found this device is more sensitive to temperature of a person's hands. There are times readings will not be produced even when a patient's hands are decently warm. Straight forward to use and decent display. This pulse ox works well... when it works.
Pulse Oximeter,4,"Oximeter arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Instructions were good but type size is very small and somewhat difficult to read.  Oximeter is easy to use and LED readings are clear.  Graph is small and too flat to be useful.  Readings were pretty accurate, but when I tested for accuracy there was some variation.  Overall a very good product."
Broken strap,4,"I love everything about this pulse oximeter. But the strap broke when I took it out of the box. Barely even pulled on it. If I can just get a new strap, I'd give it 5 stars."
Good enough for the price..,4,"seems accurate enough, the finish quality is medium at best, but for the price  is good enough."
Good value for money,4,It's worth what I paid.  I had to return first one.  Numbers went crazy on the screen.  Have not had any problems with 2nd one.
Great meter for the price.,4,Purchased for my spouse in order to check her oxygen levels after surgery. Product recommended by the hospital staff.
Holding accurate,4,"Measurements of oxygen level have been holding where my level should be.  In comparison with others that I have tried, this one is maintaining my level with previous readings at Doctors office."
Easy to Use,4,"Product is easy to use and provides readings on a very bright screen. Not sure what value the PI reading provides, my values range from 2.5 and 8."
The color display is much easier to read,4,"It seems to work well, and agrees with the unit i replaced.The case was too big for the device and looks like it was intended for something else."
easy to use,4,not familiar with it really as to how it should work cause the pulse starts high and starts to go down so I'm a little confused about that all else is great
It works well.....,4,Got it and tried it out.  Very impressed.  Will have it for when it may be needed.
Not Quite as Advertised but good,4,"I received the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter  SM-519BR-BL today.  After inserting the batteries, it worked the first time and gave me a reading in about 15 seconds.  Contrary to the ad in Amazon, only 1/2 of the inside of the oximeter is a latex silicone material.  The other half is hard plastic.  The lanyard installation could also have been easier."
Accurate and Easy to Read,4,"Accurate, bright colorful display, and shows perfusion index and plethysmography in addition to insure the pulse and 02 saturation readings are reliable and valid.  Case and batteries are included. which is nice.Took 1 point off as the casing can be tighter and more secure. Of note is that the second generation appears to be built more secure, but it does not show the perfusion index and is more expensive."
Worthwhile purchase.,4,"It's easy to use and easy to read, but isn't all that consistent. Maybe that's how it works, I get readings from 94 to 99. If that's accurate, I'm pretty safe."
Easy and quick to use,4,"The unit is great,Since I cannot measure or estimate accuracy I assume it’s accurate-  But I rated it a 3 because I don’t have data to support it"
Exactly what I was looking for!,4,Exactly what I was looking for. Fast & easy to use. Case keeps it safe & lanyard is handy as well. Very satisfied with this product.
"Good, useful device (especially for larger hands)",4,"For large hands  the device worked perfectly. However, for smaller adults hands (women) -- we had difficulty to make it work reliably...."
Worked for Us,4,We bought as directed by doctor and this model worked as advertised.
Amazing information portal,4,If I'm feeling under the weather I always use this product to check my stats
Los datos suministrados hacen dudar...,4,"El producto, tomando los datos en un mismo minuto, por decirlo así, en muchas ocasiones muestra diferencias demasiado grandes."
Easy to Use,4,Seems to work well. My only issue is my very large fingers. It seemed to read low until I used my baby finger. Then everything was fine.
Pulse oxygen results,4,Easy to read and use. Results fluctuates so I assume that’s the way for product to give a range in the pulse and oxygen readings.Didn’t get a response from the customer support to confirm reason for the fluctuation.
Easy to use and accurate,4,I am pleased with the operation and it is accurate when compared to the ones used in the hospital.In general I am pleased with the operation and consider it a bargain at the price.  I had a more expensive one from Innova and it did not last 1 year.
Good product,4,Good product it was very hand during I had the COVID
Very pleased,4,Works great so far.
Very helpful!,4,It is very fast and easy to use. Display is clear and it has all that is needed.
Easy to use and understand,4,The pulse oximeter is nice. I like the case for it. I would give it a 4.5 star review. Sometimes the pulse count seems a bit off but overall its a good tool to have and im happy we purchased it
"May save a life with quick, accurate results!",4,Works great with quick results!My only concern is it could break easily being made of plastic so overall it scored a 4 with me.Could help save lives so buy this if you love yourself or someone else!
Good product,4,Found it easy to turn the unit on but a little difficult to turn off
Easy to use.  Accurate,4,Just opened and used for first time.  So far so good.  Def easy to use. Seems accurate.  Could read through my nail tips and polish.  Will update if needed
priced right,4,all good. no probems.
Consistent readings,4,"I had tried another Oximeter but the readings were very inconsistent.  Thought I would try one more and this device is much more consistent.  I was not expecting that for the price point, but  I was pleasantly surprised.  Very happy with this device."
This does the job,4,"It seems to be pretty accurate, but at times it can take a while to get a reading. For the most part we are pretty pleased with it."
not sure it's accurate,4,I put a magic marker in it and got the same reading as my finger...
Trying yet another pulse oximeter,4,Just received my product and it seems to be working great currently so hopefully it stays a that way.
Accuracy,4,"Absolutely love it, just wish material not so much plastic. Accurate with nice screen."
So so,4,So so product
Love the product,4,I like the product since it is easy to use.  The only thing I want improvement is if there could be difference in the color of pulse and saturation for easy distinction.
Very convenient,4,"I have been using this oximeter for a few days now and find it always  convenient, reasonably accurate, and very easy to use, battery life seems quite good and i can easily recommend this product to others."
It does the job 👍,4,I like it as it does the job.

Pulse & blood sat oximeter,4,Easy to read  quick reading

Little more difficult to read than others,4,"It takes time for the reading to stabilize, price is a little on the higher side then others."
Results are jumping,4,Results are jumping.
Easy to use and easy to read,4,"The casing is a bit flimsy, but seems to work OK."
review,4,"great product, easy to use"
Simple use,4,Most important tool for Covid and any other respiratory illnesses. Works well. Even my doctor recommended it for both of us.
Good,4,"Does what it is advertised to do. Sometimes it's reading at first is inaccurate and says my pulse is exceedingly high, but after a second it makes an accurate reading."
Does what's it's supposed to do and does it accurately.,4,"Simple to use - but the screen is not so easy to read, especially for those with aging eyes. I've check it's pulse measurement against other devices that I have and it's always in agreement.  Very good buy!"
Works as expected.,4,Product is what we expected. The only issue we had was the lack of an explanation for each display on the unit. I would have liked to see an explanation for each part of the display.
Works.  Easy to use.,4,Blood O2 absorption.As advertised.
Good device for the price & perofrmance,4,"I bought SantaMedical Oximeter last week, tested with my entire family and found the device very easy to use.The blood oxygen reading very consistent & accurate.  Plan to buy for my daughters shortly."

"Good product, reasonable price. It is nice that it comes with a case for better protection",4,"The instruction is clear but the print is too small, especially for the elderly. I have to use a magnifier to read it"
Works as advertised -- glad to have one now for home and when flying,4,I've used use a very similar device at my work and was very pleased to find that yours also measures well and responds very quickly. This should be a great tool to have available at our home and when flying planes.
Worked as advertised,4,Simple to set up and use. Clear displays. Could use a little more information to the meaning of the metrics (or link to a website that provides the latest information).
Easy to use and effective,4,I made my SantaMedical pulse oximeter purchase on Amazon and I am really happy with my purchase. Results are almost consistent and it's auto turn-off feature is awesome! I give it 4 stars.

Device's Accuracy,4,Need to compare the device's accuracy against my physician's oximeter before I can rate this category.
Easy to use and read which is most important to me.,4,Four stars because I found I could not attach lanyard to Oximeter. Finally attached lanyard to carry case which might actually be a better idea. Like it otherwise.
Issue,4,"My only problem with this oximeter is the battery cover. It does not have a tight fit once the batteries are installed, and repeatedly falls off when picked up."

Useful product,4,Good product the whole family tried it out and compared results.
Peace of mind,5,"I bought this pulse oximeter after reading about the rapid decline of oxygen saturation in the blood of some of the sickest coronavirus patients.  I wanted to be able to check my oxygen level at my own pleasure without going to a physician's office.  This monitor works great in that the results are immediate, easy to read, and require only battery power.  I love the large size of the numerals on the monitor because I can read them without my glasses.  I also like that the battery power shuts off a few seconds after use so the batteries should last a long time."
Reliable & portable,5,"This is an easy to read & reliable Pulse Oximeter. When I researched an unbiased rating on Pulse Oximeters, this SantaMedical brand was listed as highest rated!"
Finally a product that works,5,"I had already returned several oximeters before I bought this one.  They either didn't work at all, or were all over the place.  After doing research off of Amazon I discovered this oximeter at the top of most lists.  It works consistently, is easy to read, and very comfortable (and does not look cheesy).  Would recommend to anyone"
Works as intended!,5,"I bought this just to keep in the house to get an accurate pulse and oxygen reading. There have been a few times in which members of my family have had incidents (ended up being not too serious) but due to the whole Covid situation, were fearful of it being something else. So we used this and then later found it was just acid reflux. Gives me peace of mind having this around."
Critically Important Device,5,"Given what is happening in the world today, self-monitoring of health is critically important. The pulse oximeter measures blood oxygen, so it could be an early indicator that an issue has arisen. The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."
User Friendly pulse oximeter,5,I give your product a rating of 5.  This rating was given because I found it very easy to get it up and running.  It’s easy to use even though I have fibromyalgia.  I expect that the quality of your product the pulse oximeter will last a long time if taken proper care of.Sincerely looking forward to using this for several years.
Good Value,5,"I Purchased this Pulse Oximeter fingertip blood oxygen saturation monitor with pulse rate measurements and pulse bar graph.  It arrived today and my wife and I tried it out.  It works fine and is light weight.  I am 69 and find the numbers and graphics readable, but I would have liked them slightly larger.  The only negative is the tiny holes for attaching the lanyard.  Overall we are very satisfied with the product."
Easy to use and Good Quality,5,"I ordered through this Pulse Oximeter, and in fact purchased a total of 6 for our family.  They arrived yesterday and we put our together, and tried it out this morning.  It worked well.We felt it a good idea for everyone to have one of these in their arsenal of medical measuring equipment, similar too thermometers.  It seems to be a good quality and came together easily.I purchased your particular product based on reviews that stated it was a high quality product as compared to other pulse oximeters. Based on our limited time with it all is as we had hoped.  We would recommend this product."
Good To Have During Covid-19 Pandemic,5,"I ordered a pulse oximeter from Santa Medical Products via Amazon on June 26, 2020 and received it on June 28, which was super fast. Medical providers are cautioning that Covid-19 sufferers who quarantine at home should monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a drop in which might signal a need for hospitalization. I don't have the coronavirus but was advised that having a pulse oximeter on hand is wise. A friend advised me that Santa Medical is reputable and provides high-quality devices. I am very impressed with the quick shipment, the oximeter’s ease of use, and especially with the clarity of the operation manual, which is thorough and easy to understand. The device runs on two AAA batteries, which are included, and comes with a lanyard and a handy carry case to keep it clean. I am very impressed with this purchase and would definitely recommend Santa Medical and this pulse oximeter to anyone who wants to be proactive about their health in this frightening time of global pandemic."
"burberry 7 with the “stuffed animal test” is wrong, and here’s why:",5,"Ok, I want to first want to preface this by saying that I’m a medical doctor, so I do know a thing about pulse oximeters—both in theory and in practice.  I noticed the top review has a picture of the pulse ox on a stuffed animal, showing at 99%, as “proof” it is inaccurate equipment.There are a number of problems with this supposition, and it shows a basic lack of understanding of how pulse oxes work.  They are equipment that are designed to measure something specific under specific circumstances of being clipped to a fingernail with no opaque polish.  NOT inanimate objects like markers and stuffed animals.A pulse ox works by shooting red light across the width of one of the middle fingers.  Since tissues are translucent rather than totally opaque, the amount of light that is measured at the receiving sensor measures the proportionality of absorbed red light, which equals the proportion of material that absorbs it.  This is called Beer’s Law.  Pulse oxes are also governed by another law called Lambert’s Law, which says the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.  The third law has to do with the fact that oxygenated hemoglobin (which in itself is red) absorbs more light than deoxygenated hemoglobin.  This is due to the difference in wavelengths of red and blue light (red objects absorb more red light than blue objects).  This is also why the test is not accurate if you have red nail polish on or your finger is not centered and light can move around it (or if you use a tiny pinky finger, for example).  You can now see why it’s totally irrelevant how using a pulse ox on an inanimate object (especially, a bright red felt tail!) with totally different properties than an index finger is not a good way to judge accuracy.  That’s like saying that your kitchen scale did not work well because you threw it in a swimming pool to measure the weight of the water.  Equipment is only designed to work under particular circumstances and limitations.Anyway, I purchased this pulse ox for my father.  He has COPD and a bunch of other risk factors for COVID-19, so I appreciate having a heads up if his oxygen sats dip.  This is a good vital sign early marker for covid because it is an unusual disease, in that it causes what doctors have nicknamed “happy hypoxia”.  You can google this to find out more, but it basically means that in other pneumonias that devolve rapidly into hypoxic conditions that require ventilation, their symptoms also crash, to the point where they lose consciousness or can barely talk.  Covid-19 is more insidious and can creep up on some patients, who might be sitting up in bed (yes, symptomatic, but still conscious and talking), fooling even medical professionals into thinking their cases were not too serious until it was too late.  This is the reason medical professionals find pulse oxes to be useful—they measure signs of disease (objective results from testing) rather than symptoms (subjective reports of feelings from patients).  It gives me peace of mind to know my father has this and can measure it daily when he does his insulin shots and measures BP.  He has chronic bronchitis, diabetes, stroke history, high blood pressure, obesity, and he is nearly 80, so he’s definitely in that very high risk category.On the actual unit, it was extremely easy to set up and use.  You press a button and it turns on (once you put the batteries in the right way, lol); turns off automatically.  I didn’t find anything inaccurate about it... and the hardest part of it was probably getting the lanyard in, haha (I advise using a needle to get the other end out of the hole; there’s no way a senior citizen could do this alone, so please help them).  I’ve used many pulse oxes in my day.  The professional ones in the hospitals are about 1% more accurate than these little portable, cheap pieces of equipment that you can buy for the home.  I highly recommend them for any patients or elderly who have risk factors or disease comorbidities (especially, pulmonary).  These little portable ones were sold out for months during the pandemic first peak (even hospital staff had trouble getting their hands on privately sold ones), so I’m glad to have one now."

The Santa Medical pulse oximeter is compact, easy to use, and gives the user the necessary information in seconds. (I am relieved and delighted every day when I see my measurement.) I strongly recommend this device to anyone and everyone."
User Friendly pulse oximeter,5,I give your product a rating of 5.  This rating was given because I found it very easy to get it up and running.  It’s easy to use even though I have fibromyalgia.  I expect that the quality of your product the pulse oximeter will last a long time if taken proper care of.Sincerely looking forward to using this for several years.
Good Value,5,"I Purchased this Pulse Oximeter fingertip blood oxygen saturation monitor with pulse rate measurements and pulse bar graph.  It arrived today and my wife and I tried it out.  It works fine and is light weight.  I am 69 and find the numbers and graphics readable, but I would have liked them slightly larger.  The only negative is the tiny holes for attaching the lanyard.  Overall we are very satisfied with the product."
Easy to use and Good Quality,5,"I ordered through this Pulse Oximeter, and in fact purchased a total of 6 for our family.  They arrived yesterday and we put our together, and tried it out this morning.  It worked well.We felt it a good idea for everyone to have one of these in their arsenal of medical measuring equipment, similar too thermometers.  It seems to be a good quality and came together easily.I purchased your particular product based on reviews that stated it was a high quality product as compared to other pulse oximeters. Based on our limited time with it all is as we had hoped.  We would recommend this product."
Good To Have During Covid-19 Pandemic,5,"I ordered a pulse oximeter from Santa Medical Products via Amazon on June 26, 2020 and received it on June 28, which was super fast. Medical providers are cautioning that Covid-19 sufferers who quarantine at home should monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a drop in which might signal a need for hospitalization. I don't have the coronavirus but was advised that having a pulse oximeter on hand is wise. A friend advised me that Santa Medical is reputable and provides high-quality devices. I am very impressed with the quick shipment, the oximeter’s ease of use, and especially with the clarity of the operation manual, which is thorough and easy to understand. The device runs on two AAA batteries, which are included, and comes with a lanyard and a handy carry case to keep it clean. I am very impressed with this purchase and would definitely recommend Santa Medical and this pulse oximeter to anyone who wants to be proactive about their health in this frightening time of global pandemic."
"burberry 7 with the “stuffed animal test” is wrong, and here’s why:",5,"Ok, I want to first want to preface this by saying that I’m a medical doctor, so I do know a thing about pulse oximeters—both in theory and in practice.  I noticed the top review has a picture of the pulse ox on a stuffed animal, showing at 99%, as “proof” it is inaccurate equipment.There are a number of problems with this supposition, and it shows a basic lack of understanding of how pulse oxes work.  They are equipment that are designed to measure something specific under specific circumstances of being clipped to a fingernail with no opaque polish.  NOT inanimate objects like markers and stuffed animals.A pulse ox works by shooting red light across the width of one of the middle fingers.  Since tissues are translucent rather than totally opaque, the amount of light that is measured at the receiving sensor measures the proportionality of absorbed red light, which equals the proportion of material that absorbs it.  This is called Beer’s Law.  Pulse oxes are also governed by another law called Lambert’s Law, which says the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the length of the path that the light has to travel in the absorbing substance.  The third law has to do with the fact that oxygenated hemoglobin (which in itself is red) absorbs more light than deoxygenated hemoglobin.  This is due to the difference in wavelengths of red and blue light (red objects absorb more red light than blue objects).  This is also why the test is not accurate if you have red nail polish on or your finger is not centered and light can move around it (or if you use a tiny pinky finger, for example).  You can now see why it’s totally irrelevant how using a pulse ox on an inanimate object (especially, a bright red felt tail!) with totally different properties than an index finger is not a good way to judge accuracy.  That’s like saying that your kitchen scale did not work well because you threw it in a swimming pool to measure the weight of the water.  Equipment is only designed to work under particular circumstances and limitations.Anyway, I purchased this pulse ox for my father.  He has COPD and a bunch of other risk factors for COVID-19, so I appreciate having a heads up if his oxygen sats dip.  This is a good vital sign early marker for covid because it is an unusual disease, in that it causes what doctors have nicknamed “happy hypoxia”.  You can google this to find out more, but it basically means that in other pneumonias that devolve rapidly into hypoxic conditions that require ventilation, their symptoms also crash, to the point where they lose consciousness or can barely talk.  Covid-19 is more insidious and can creep up on some patients, who might be sitting up in bed (yes, symptomatic, but still conscious and talking), fooling even medical professionals into thinking their cases were not too serious until it was too late.  This is the reason medical professionals find pulse oxes to be useful—they measure signs of disease (objective results from testing) rather than symptoms (subjective reports of feelings from patients).  It gives me peace of mind to know my father has this and can measure it daily when he does his insulin shots and measures BP.  He has chronic bronchitis, diabetes, stroke history, high blood pressure, obesity, and he is nearly 80, so he’s definitely in that very high risk category.On the actual unit, it was extremely easy to set up and use.  You press a button and it turns on (once you put the batteries in the right way, lol); turns off automatically.  I didn’t find anything inaccurate about it... and the hardest part of it was probably getting the lanyard in, haha (I advise using a needle to get the other end out of the hole; there’s no way a senior citizen could do this alone, so please help them).  I’ve used many pulse oxes in my day.  The professional ones in the hospitals are about 1% more accurate than these little portable, cheap pieces of equipment that you can buy for the home.  I highly recommend them for any patients or elderly who have risk factors or disease comorbidities (especially, pulmonary).  These little portable ones were sold out for months during the pandemic first peak (even hospital staff had trouble getting their hands on privately sold ones), so I’m glad to have one now."
"Accurate, easy to use and read.",5,"As a former  operating room & surgical intensive care nurse I can say that this oximeter works as well as the finger clips we used that were connected to the monitoring systems that also included cardiac, blood pressure, central veinus pressure & intracranial pressure monitoring. I purchased this oximeter for my personal use mainly at home to monitor my oxygen levels during bouts of bronchitis & because I have asthma. The multi colored readout is bright & easy to see, the print is large enough for easy reading & pulse waive form tracing allows you easily make sure you have the monitor placed correctly on your finger. The added reading of the Perfusion Index let's you & your doctor know how well blood is circulating to the fingers & can help identify any possible blood flow problems. I highly recommend this pulse oximeter to anyone wishing to monitor their blood oxygenation."
It works and extra reading for PI is useful.,5,"This actually worked. I liked it has an extra setting for PI. I looked up what that was and it is very confusing in medical terms, from what I can tell if it is very low like less than 1% it means you have poor blood circulation and if it is too low then your oxygen percent may not be accurate. I noticed when my hands were cold I was less than 1% but when my hands were warm I was around 3%. It is going to be different for everybody so they can’t tell you what’s good or bad. My boyfriend was like 6% and yeah he’s got red hot blood LOL! But the point of including that number is so you know if it is less than 1% perhaps you should try jumping up and down and getting your blood moving and then check your oxygen again.I specifically ordered this to check my oxygen levels during the coronavirus pandemic. I wasn’t going to overreact and buy one except I was having shortness of breath. Turns out it was a new cat litter I am having allergies to. But at least I am able to check myself at home so that I am not feeling nearly as paranoid.I’m not sure if this is going to be very durable but because I have small fingers and I am very careful when I open it it seems sturdy enough for me. But when my boyfriend went to open it on his big finger he almost broke it I could hear the springs having a problem so you need to be careful not to just open it as big as it will go."
Essential part of Covid-19 surveillance toolkit for any family!,5,"This compares readout wise with a different brand I bought but with the addition of the PI% Perfusion Index information which is also a helpful indicator of health.  Every family's arsenal of COVID-19 counter weapons should include a pulse oximeter like this as well as a good touchess digital thermometer made for body temperature range and Hydrogen Peroxide and a nebulizer for home treatment to cut it off at the pass if someone shows a fever and/or a dropping oxygen level below 96% or 95% for a smoker.  These tools have kept my family safe, and detected and killed a COVID-19 infection for me personally.  Without detection and treatment available at home, you are at enhanced risk!  Don't trust your health to a health care system that's primary aim is to turn a profit.  Take things into you own hands and you are far better off!  See the Health Daily article with Dr. Levy online for information about Hyrogen Peroxide nebulizer therapy.  That information saved my life and it can save yours too... even from other viral infections such as West Nile virus or more common flu."
Amazon's policies,5,"My last review wasn't accepted. I guess because it had a brief opinion on how this could help people earlier than when they are bad enough to be hospitalized. I think this is restricting my FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!  I wasn't prescribing anything just making a helpful suggestion. Amazon tends to be way too liberal in it's political views and restrictive of anyone who doesn't see things in that light. I will cancel my Amazon Prime and I will limit any future purchases from Amazon in the future until I see this corrected. It's not your place to stifle your customers opinions. My review was not damaging and didn't go against any of your guidelines unless your company supports the liberal position that we can't help ourselves and we must be sent home to worry, wonder and possibly die because our doctors aren't supporting first aide self help!  I WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS NOT TO SUPPORT YOUR COMPANY AS WELL."
Saved my boyfriend’s life from COVID!,5,"I felt so stupid buying this.  I got it once I was pretty sure we were about to test positive at our house.  I knew in our 40s we were low risk and we never go to the doctor so it felt silly, but I did it. I stayed at 99%. No issues.  Out of nowhere, my boyfriend wakes up and can’t breathe - no previous symptoms and no pre-existing conditions. I knew what it had to be and checked his oxygen and it was at 71% and I knew it was ER time.  He was nearly unconscious by the time we made it and they said he got there in time as they also read him at 71% 15 mins later. Scariest thing ever and had we not had this he’d have kept trying to self treat at home until it was too late. He works in construction and we had no idea he’d have the reaction he did, but this monitor let me know what the issue was and get him help in time.  I ordered and sent one to my mom immediately after."
SpO2 Matches Dr  Office,5,"If you are buying this, it is likely for the SpO2 reading. While this is good to know in today's COVID world, I actually have wanted one since I was hospitalized with bronchitis about a year ago. Since my SpO2 levels had been pretty low, I was concerned about them. I did not realize a device such as this was so inexpensive so never really looked fro one.Fast forward to this year with COVID going around. I heard people talk of buying their own pulse oximeter. That prompted me to search for one. I was lucky enough to find this one for a reasonable price. More importantly, it works great and the SpO2 level it reports matches that in my Dr.'s office. Though the heart rate does not match my watch perfectly (and that could be my watch that is off), I bought this for the SpO2, and like I said, that is accurate.  It is simple to use and even has a nice little carrying case. Very happy with this purchase."
Nice Pulse Oximeter,5,"The Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter (SM-519BR-BL) arrived quickly. The Pulse Oximeter itself appears as pictured on Amazon. It is lightweight and comes with a sturdy, woven nylon carrying case which utilizes a velcro closure. On the back of the case, there's a webbed 1"" wide loop that allows this unit to be worn on a belt. Alternatively, the plastic D-ring sewn onto the back of the case would allow the oximeter to be clipped onto other gear. If you choose to use the lanyard to wear the unit around your neck, I'd advise putting the case on it to provide some additional protection.  The pulse ox display screen is clear, bright, crisp and easy to read. It took the unit 4-5 seconds to display myresults, although the manual states the ""Data update period is less than 30 seconds."" After removing yourfinger, your data disappears. Before the display totally blacks out, the screen shows ""Bye-bye""; a surprise thatmade me smile & let me know that someone in the develpoment team has a sense of humor.  This unit also comes with a lanyard, which the purchaser is to install. The lanyard itself seems sturdy and has a easy to use detachable clip to separate the device from the lanyard if the user wishes. The portion of the lanyard that attaches to the unit is a 3"" (approx.) loop of thin, woven, nylon type cord. The ends of this thin cord are attached to one end of the detachabe clip. The wider part of the lanyard that is meant to go around your neck is 1/3"" wide, flat webbed material that is attached to the other end of the detachable clip.  The difficulty that I experienced was attaching the lanyard to the pulse ox unit. As per manual instrustions, I attempted to ""Thread the thinner end of the lanyard through the lanyard hole."" I was able to thread the thin cord loop (collapsed) into the lanyard hole but, the cord wasn't stiff enough to push out through the other side of the hole; tried about 10 times and was getting no where fast. Then I tried using the point of a pin to try & snag the loop cord since it was visible but just inside the lanyard exit hole; no good & I didn't want to scratch the unit. The solution that finally worked for me: I used an eight inch length of sewing thread, ran it through the thin cord loop then brought the ends of the thread together. I gently pushed the ends of the thread through the lanyard hole and it brought the thin cord loop through the hole easily.Donna Beebe 8/16/20"
Easy to use,5,Bought this to keep an eye on oxygen saturation as I am getting older and with COVID. Come the one with the best reviews. I was pleasantly surprised the package came with nice clear instructions and was up and running in minutes. There is no way yo assess accuracy but it was reading what I expected. Very pleased with the purchase. Some minor things that could be improved include:Directions:1. Make sure to tell people when/where to turn it on.2. Would be nice to have some explanation of the plethysmograph wave.As for the device:1. Would be nice if it beeped or flashed or something when it was done reading.2. No off switch. I guess this is OK since it turns off pretty quickly by itself.3. After a reading the top part of device doesn’t always fit into bottom part when finger is removed. It goes down OK but needs a little jiggling to settle it down.4. I didn’t find a need for a lanyard but probably others do.
Excellent product!,5,"I am a nurse in a very 6 doctor practice. I take vitals constantly and the time this pulse Oximeter saves me and the accuracy of it gives me the confidence in my reading to chart as legal medical record. A great feature is that it’s hinged to adjusts to the size and girth of the finger, it’s comfortable lightweight and rapid results with precise accuracy. I highly recommend this unit for the reasons described. Plus it comes with its own storage pouch and lanyard so you always have it when you need it. I will by more of your products."
Great for People with Asthma!,5,"I am a 25-year-old male, I have asthma, and right now I am maybe 10-20 pounds overweight. I have relatively well-controlled asthma, however, sometimes if I get sick my asthma gets pretty bad. Given that we are in a global pandemic with a disease that is usually severe for people like me, I decided that even though my SPO2 levels sometimes dip below my typical 98-99% levels, it's very important to take your vitals daily, at specific times if you have a routine, in order to get a baseline for what is normal for you. This is a better indicator of whether or not you are sick with either a respiratory disease and/or your asthma/other respiratory condition is worse one-day-verses another. This partcicular SPO2 metering device was priced well & is very accurate. Some of my complaints are that it is made in a way that contributes to climate change and environmental pollution. This pollution is the very reason for not only destroying our planet, but why people like myself develop asthma in the first place. However, despite this, this product is worth the money and my health is very important.This may seem boring, but, I hope this was helpful."
Simple. Does what it should,5,"Purchased this O2 monitor while recovering from pneumonia. It arrived quickly and I found it very simple to use. Readings came up quickly (much sooner than the 30 seconds noted). Reading are consistent and don't seem to vary around more than 1%. Operation is very simple. Put it on a finger, relax the finger, press the button.The readout is large and bright so I can read it without glasses. I examined the O2 sensor used at my doctor's office and it appears to be the same unit I'm using. good enough for me.I recommend."
Great buy!,5,"Love this pulse oximeter. This is my 2nd purchase. Ordered this before, before the pandemic, for my emergency kit for our home and for the reason that me and my son has asthma we wanna make sure that our SPO2 is within the normal range and i order again to bring with me in my purse all the time. Accurate I must say. And is very convenient, compact, portable and easy to use. Just throw in your purse, it's safe since it comes with pouch and lanyard. This will be a great gift for medical workers or just for personal use. I will definitely recommend this."
Works exactly as expected,5,"Having a bad cough, I was tested for COVID and the flu, but both came back negative but there was concern over my blood oxygen level at 93%. I got my prescription and ordered this all in the same day. After starting the antibiotic, my levels were back up to 99% but have seen them drop immediately after a coughing fit. The price was good and the ratings were high, and I would agree with the ratings. Five stars. Nice to have a reference level that I can trust."
Easy to Read and Operate,5,"This monitor arrives securely packaged with a set of batteries, lanyard and convenient storage pouch that has a secure but easy to open velcro flap.  The device has an easy slide battery compartment making the batteries easy to install. It is user friendly but this one did not come with any information regarding the normal ranges for the readings.  That is easily solved with a quick Google search but it would have been nice to include a printout.  It is easy to open, not too fussy about finger placement and easy to read.  Turning it off did create some confusion for the person using it because it flashed Bye bye a bit too quickly to be noticeable so there were a couple of tries before feeling comfortable with that process."
Does what it says...and well,5,"Okay, some reviews have complained about the accuracy of this unit but honestly, it falls well within tolerances for every day use. IF you need this for a medical setting where a one or 2 percent value is critical, then you need to buy one that costs many hundreds. Of course, if your OSAT is down to under 90, the minor percent may be critical but at those very low levels you will likely be on oxygen or in a medical setting and not at home. During the COVID-19 crisis, it is smart to know where your oxygen levels lie. The difference during each and every measurement can be different depending on your lung intake volume, the temperature, and other factors that are beyond your and the pulse oximeter capabilities. Personally, I think this is a great little unit at a price most can afford."
Easy to use and easy to read.,5,"I gave this Pulse Ox a 5 star because it is easy to use and easy to read. I cannot tell if it’s 100% accurate, but it appears to be. A normal healthy person should have an oxygen saturation above approximately 94% and this one reads that way. I’ve had a saturation above 96% which would be normal for me. I am a non-smoker, healthy 50+ year old female.  I worked as a Respiratory Therapist for about 20 years so I have a pretty good knowledge on how Pulse Ox’s work."
Easy to use and fast delivery,5,"The order came in one day. Opened, inserted the battery and I was off and running.  The screen was very easy to read.  I did a quick Google search to see what PI (the bottom number on the screen) meant.  I cannot speak about the accuracy because I bought this device for home use.  I thought it would be good to add to my first aid kit in light of respiratory issues related to Covid-19.  Just an added tool to have on hand, God forbid, I should be infected.The quality looks good. The fact that it came with batteries and a case to protect it was an added convenience. I'm not sure if I'll need the lanyard but nice to have for the future I suppose."
"Simple to use, easy to read, actually works",5,"When I first got this unit, I immediately installed the included AAA batteries and tested it by holding my breath.After 1 minute of holding my breath, then breathing heavily, I saw the readings begin to decrease at around the 55 seconds mark, continuing to decrease even when I started breathing heavily again, eventually bottoming out at a 90% SpO2 reading.After 2 minutes of holding my breath (and getting really dizzy, seeing stars in my visual field), I was able to achieve a 82% SpO2 reading.With normal breathing, I used the device throughout the day and found I was always between 96-99% SpO2.I was amazed at how quickly my SpO2 recovers to above 96% when I start breathing again after the holding-my-breath experiments above. It's fully recovered within 15 seconds of when I restart breathing again.I don't have access to a calibration standard or a calibrated hospital-grade pulse oximeter, so I have no idea exactly how accurate this thing is, but it very clearly detects blood oxygen level. At the very least, it seems plausible it could detect the ""silent hypoxia"" that some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers have."
Easy to read digital display,5,The device is compact and turns on/off easily with the push of a button. The readings begin quickly after securing the meter to an index finger and the LED display is brightly lit and easy to read.  I can’t speak to accuracy because I don’t have another meter to compare it against but I plan to use it as a baseline for comparative purposes.
Inexpensive well build digital OX & PULSE sampler,5,"Bought to have on hand to check ox levels in event get sick. Assume its accurate but no way to know at this point as shows 98% saturation, my phone measures at 95% so for home usage, it is fine. My brother in law got an ox meter, got covid and his ox level was 84%. That single measurement put him in hospital on oxygen under active Dr. care and it was the concern that has now put him on mend. Disclaimer says not for medical usage but measuring  oxygen & pulse is same for exercise as sickness measurement. Thats why I bought it! Well built, has carry pouch, batteries and easy to use"
works well,5,"One of the first things that supposedly happens when you get covid, is that your oxygen levels fall.So, it's always nice to have one of these on hand. After checking reviews, I chose this one, and it has not been a disappointment. A couple of days ago I woke up being dizzy and nauseous. I checked my oxy levels, and they were 99 % . Turns out it was an impacted ear drum, and when I got it cleaned out I was a lot better.But it helps to have an assurance that it's not serious."
An excellent product all around,5,"Overall I found this pulse oximeter to be easy to use and well made.  I particularly like the display.  The display is sharp, bright and easy to read in any light.  The device is comfortable and fits well over the finger.  The design would seem to accommodate all sizes of fingers from child to adult.  The build quality is excellent with no sharp edges or poorly fitting parts.  The inclusion of the perfusion index (PI %) reading is a nice feature for those interested in a deeper look into their cardiovascular system.  While exceedingly easy to use, the user guide goes into some of the technical details of how the product works which is interesting for techie types like me."
Decent and fast reading,5,Been to Dr office multiple times and did side by side with theirs.  Was within 1 point. Very satisfied.  Almost instant reading.
I really like all the features of this Pulse Oximeter!,5,"I bought a medical grade pulse oximeter 11 years ago because my elderly Mom needed one. I paid $300 for it then! There were none available for much cheaper. I was amazed to find this one for under $25. I checked it against my $300 one that still works like a champ and this one was accurate. I am pleasantly surprised at the features that my expensive one did not have. I don't know if it will last 11 years like my $300 model. Only time will tell. But for this price, I could buy one every year for 11 years and the price would still be less than my other one! I bought this one for my 50-year-old daughter, who is always using mine. I know she will be very happy with it."
Better Than Expected,5,"The Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2) was delivered timely and well packaged.  Everything was included, with easy to understand instructions, except for the battery markings inside the actual oximeter were very hard to see.  It took me about 3 minutes and a magnifying glass to finally locate the positive and negative marks.  Also if you look at the instructions, the gold bands of the batteries are facing the same which would make you think the batteries go in the same direction, which they do not! They actually face opposite, as in most, but not all things.  That is my only comment to watch for.After getting the batteries inserted correctly, the unit powers up easily, is easy to read and seems very accurate. So I'm very happy with the purchase and recommend it!!"
Reasonably priced oximeter,5,"After receiving a recommendation to have an oximeter available during the Covid-19 crisis, I chose this one based on reviews and relatively low price. My husband and I did a test run when we received it - the screen is easy to read and provides a readout quickly. It also comes with a carrying case with lanyard. As far as accuracy - ... without another one on hand, we're trusting that it's giving us correct readings. Hopefully we don't contract Covid and have complications - but if we do, it is comforting to know we have this device to monitor ourselves so we know when to go to the hospital."
I'm very pleased,5,"To use it, sit down and relax. Put a finger in the monitor and press the button. Wait patiently for the reading to appear. Moving around, etc. makes the reading change continuously. It decreases the O2 saturation level and increases the beats per minute as compared to the resting values. When done, remove your finger from the monitor, sanitize it if necessary, and put it away. The button does not need to be pressed to turn it off. It shuts off automatically. The carrying case with lanyard is wonderful since I need to attach things to other things so that I don't lose them. I have to have my temperature taken before I can enter the building when work begins again. I want to be able to monitor myself better by using the O2 saturation level along with body temperature. The battery monitor is helpful. The back panel slides off. It takes two AAA batteries. The instructions paper fits inside the carrying case along with the monitor, if that's where you would like to keep it. I can't judge the accuracy because I don't have a professional monitor. I can say that the values are similar to my usual values. I am very pleased. It's a good value."
Works great and easy to use,5,Ordered my own pulse oximeter so I would have it after discharge from hospital. One Respiratory therapist told me after I ordered it that most of the cheap ones only work for a couple weeks and in order to get a quality one I would need to spend twice as much. However when it arrived the director looked at the brand as I was taking it or of the box and told me that she had a couple of this brand and they last better than most others and she prefers the SantaMedical. After having many different ones on my finger in both the hospital and Rehab this one gives me a reading fast and accurate. I’m impressed that it comes with a one year warranty as well.
Glad I purchased this,5,"My visit to the dermatologist's office the other day required getting my temp checked at the door. They also did a pulse ox. To my surprise, my pulse ox registered 92.  I had to take a deep breath to hit 93--the entry threshold. The PA asked if I had COPD or had ever smoked. No and no.  When I got home I ordered this pulse ox and figured I'd monitor myself for a couple weeks before seeing a doctor about it. My readings are in the high 90's consistently, so that's one less thing to worry about. Easy to read and use. I'm glad I got it."
Great Product - Poor Delivery,5,"The delivery report on Amazon said that the package with this product and one more product was left in the ""mail room"".  But, there is NO mailroom at the address the package was delivered.  The front door is open to this office building and the delivery address was to Suite 18; anyone can go right up to the door of Suite 18, but my cousin said that the package was left on the floor after opening up the main door to the building where anyone could take it.  The address on the package said ""Suite 18"", so why didn't the Amazon driver bring it to Suite 18?  Disappointed, but more than that, the driver lied when he/she reported that it was left in the ""mail room"" - as mentioned, there is no mail room..."
Good At What It Does,5,"We recently ordered and received the SantaMedical fingertip pulseox meter. We love this thing. The display is very easy to read and, honestly, is beautiful. It fits very comfortably over the finger. One of the things I like most about this product is the literature it comes with. It explains exactly what is happening and how the meter works. It was quite educational, especially to an engineer like me. I also like the little carrying case and lanyard that it comes with. All well thought out. I highly recommend this PulseOx meter and believe that with the threat of Covid lingering around every corner, this is something you’ll want on hand before you get sick, not after."
Very easy to use,5,"It is very easy to read and use and super comfortable to wear on your finger.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I used one that my parents bought.  It had a slightly stronger grip on my finger and it had to be read by holding it sideways if you were only using it on your right hand.  I like this one better because you can read it while holding any finger straight up and down and not sideways...so it doesn't matter if you are right-handed or left-handed.If I would change anything, it would be the installation of the lanyard.  It was very difficult to put in through the tiny holes and the instructions were of no help because the picture was too dark and the written instructions didn't tell you how to do it.  I did eventually get it in and attached.  I have used it many times now and I find it to be quite accurate."
"Quick Delivery, Great Quality",5,"I was very pleased to find this monitor with so many features and great quality at such a reasonable price.  And the delivery actually arrived ahead of schedule.  My old pulse oximeter finally gave up the ghost just as I was getting ready for a camping/hiking trip with my best friend!! I depend on it to monitor my pulmonary health due to the fact that I survived a lengthy battle with Legionnaire's Disease in 2012.  It left me with lung damage and symptoms of COPD which seem to get a little worse with each passing year.  I live an active lifestyle to support my pulmonary health by camping, hiking and walking.  My husband also uses it and the adjustable fitting for the finger sensor accommodates my small fingers as well as his much larger fingers comfortably. The monitor helps me to know when it's time to take a rest so I was very pleased it came in time for my trip. Thank you SantaMedical."
A Must for Every Home,5,"I am very happy with the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter I ordered through Amazon.com.  It was easy to set-up, easy to use, easy to read, and very accurate--matched perfectly with the doctor's office oximeter.  We believe that an oximeter is as important to have in your home as a thermometer, especially in this era of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19.  A drop in oxygen levels is a key sign that you should seek medical attention.We gave our old oximeter to a family member who was diagnosed with COVID-19.  I researched available oximeters and found that the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter had the highest ratings from customers and was very reasonably priced.  No home should be without an oximeter."
Works perfectly!,5,"I'm 72 years old. I've never smoked, but I do have a pacemaker. I had a pulmonary infection from some unknown cause that required me to take an ambulance to the ER. After they ruled out COVID-19 and heart problems the hospital simply sent me home. I had periods where I simply couldn't get my breath. I ordered the oximeter to give me some feedback on how well I was absorbing oxygen. It worked perfectly. I tried to rehab myself by taking short walks, and I had problems walking even a short block before I had to stop and get my breath. I was worried about how well my lungs were working, but using the oximeter while I was walking reassured me that my blood oxygen level was 96-99 percent. A couple of times when it got down to 95% I supplemented my breath from a canister of oxygen I got from the sporting goods store. I found it took about 90 seconds before the oximeter  recorded an increase in blood oxygen. This helped me balance my effort to what I could actually do.I have both a Fitbit and a Polar chest-strap heart rate monitor. My Fitbit was showing major fluctuations in my heart rate, so I also started wearing the Polar for my walks. The two devices were showing different heart rates, but by comparing the two devices to the readout on the oximeter I was able to determine that the Polar device was malfunctioning, and once I cleaned the lights on the Fitbit, it was almost exactly comparable to what the oximeter was showing.All told, this device has been a great help in my recovery. There is a major reassurance to knowing that the chest discomfort from exercising is a result of low conditioning and that I wasn't starving for oxygen. This is a great device!My pulmonary infection went away after about 92 days. My resting heart rate went down from the upper 80s back down to a normal 71 bpm. These days my blood oxygen level reads a normal 90-99% and I trust this device to report it correctly. If it ever breaks, I will buy another just like it. The price was right (about 1/3 the price at Walgreens), it is comfortable to use, and I can see the readout clearly at a glance, even while I'm walking fast."
Reasonable Blood Oxygen & Pulse Rate Monitor,5,I’ve purchased blood pressure monitors and thermometers before but then I noticed these oximeters becoming popular in recent years.  Why pay a doctor’s office money for some procedure as simple as this when you can easily do it yourself?  So I did a little research and ordered this SantaMedical Duel Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Blood Oxygen Saturation & Pulse Rate Monitor.  Received just in time 06/16/2020.Accuracy:  I’m going to assume the readings are accurate because the each day the results are within 2-3% range each time!Easy To Read:  No problem.  Display is bright for easy viewing!Easy To Use:  Yes; Very!I can’t complain and I would recommend this product.  It’s not the most expensive device and not the cheapest either.  Give it a try!
"Great price for a handy, well made product.",5,I ordered this device primarily because of the current COVID epidemic.  It was ordered  Thursday July 2 and I received it Monday July 6. — very prompt delivery given the holiday weekend.Positives: Well packaged Batteries were included Easy to read  — I’m an older person with vision problems and the bright display is helpful Accurate as far as I can tell.  The pulse reading matches that of my Apple Watch Very easy to use I like the case that it comes with — should keep it safe in my bathroom drawer It seems sturdy and well made. Because COVID sometimes causes a drop in blood oxygen level without the person being aware I expect this device could be helpful in monitoring our status at home.Negatives: Haven’t had it very long but so far zero complaints
Just in case ...,5,"I purchased this item hoping to never have to use it. With COVID being so prevalent today, and with a personal history of asthma with occasional shortness of breath, I figured it would be good to have a pulse oximeter in the house in case symptoms suddenly showed up. I know that the O2 level is something that is an important factor and having a pulse oximeter that will allow you to have that information in case you're making decisions about going to the hospital, this is money well spent. It was very easy to use. At first attempt to get a reading, I clearly did not have my finger positioned correctly and the reading was lower than expected. Once I repositioned after reading the instructions, the readings were fine. This is very simple to use and clear to read. Now hopefully, it'll stay in my drawer and I won't have occasion to use it!!"
Reliable and Easy-to-Use,5,"I needed a reliable pulse oximeter to track data for pre-existing health issues unrelated to COVID-19, so I did a fair amount of research before making this purchase. I’ve found it to be accurate and easy-to-use. It does seem to have issues getting a reading when my hands are cold, but all pulse oximeters have limitations, especially when circulation is reduced. This can be quickly resolved by warming up the hands and increasing blood flow. All-in-all, I trust this device and would both recommend and purchase again if/when needed."
A must have in my opinion,5,"I want to say that this probe played a part in saving my life. I had Covid and was at home battling it. It was suggested I get a pulse oximetry device so I ordered this one. As soon as it arrived I put it on and it read 71%. Not thinking that was right I put it on my wife and daughter. They read 98%. As everyone in the house was sick with Covid we called 911. The monitor EMS was using read the same, 71%. Lets just say I got to the hospital in time or else it was going to be a bad Xmas. I appreciate that this item was so accurate and thats the reason I feel it played a part in saving my life."
Great product - will purchase again!,5,I received this package within 2 days. It's great! Very easy to see the numbers on the screen. Easy to be sure the Oxygen levels are where they should be - especially during these times! I really appreciated the quick shipping as I have not been able to update my old mercury thermometer. This is something that gives peace of mind - should something come up (like a temperature). I'll be purchasing others as gifts.I did not have any problems feeding in the lanyard. Once I saw it only needed to feed in 1 corner and not across the back of them item - it was installed very quickly. Just another measure to take care the item is not damaged or lost when in use.Thanks again VERY MUCH!
Handy addn to the 2020 medicine cabinet,5,"If you want an almost instant read on your pulse ox, this is a useful and accurate unit to have. All you do is put your finger in, hold your hand still, and in seconds, the reading displays. I've found there's a sweet spot in getting an accurate reading, so don't stick your finger in so far, your nail hits the side. The reading may change by a point or two, but I think the usefulness comes in knowing if your pulse ox is down by 5 or 6 points, not by 1 or 2. I'm glad to have it in these times of Covid19 and use it almost daily, in addn to a thermometer. On sale, it was very reasonably priced at $20. I can't think of a single thing I don't like about it, so if you need one, this is a winner."
Perfect for us!,5,"My son has heart issues and is currently on the list for a transplant. We use this frequently when he feels light headed to see if we need to go to the ER. It works great and is very accurate. One night our son woke us up to a racing heartbeat and this pulse ox was spot on with how fast it was going - too fast to be normal but not fast enough for our son's ICD to shock him. We went to the ER where they did actually have to shock him but without an accurate reading, we may have waited longer than was safe. Would recommend."
"Pretty straightforward, easy to read, quick results",5,"Bought this to replace a glitchy pulse-ox in my first aid kit where the display only worked intermittently.  It's decent upgrade from the old one.  It has a crisp, backlit color display and show a graph on the right hand side that indicates pulse rate.  O2 was top center and pulse rate just below that on the display.  Read very quickly after it started up.  O2 accuracy matched my old one so going to say it's on point and with the Apple watch matching on pulse rate, but I don't have more accurate equipment to test it against.Came with a small case, wrist strap, and two generic batteries that I'll probably replace with decent rechargeable ones."
Great aid for oxygen level assessment,5,"I ordered the Gurin Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter through Oximeter Superstore on Amazon and received it earlier than predicted (June 3, 2020).  I love the product.  I give it a 5 star rating as the numbers are clear to read and the instructions are super easy to understand.  After placing the oximeter on my finger, the results came up efficiently and updated to give me an accurate assessment of my oxygen levels.  Thank you for placing this product on the market.  In this uncertain era of Covid, I believe this is a product that will benefit those who are recovering from symptoms at home. Reporting the numbers to a health care provider aids in assessing the situation and how to proceed with recovery."
Great value and easy to use,5,"After a recent surgery, it was noted on discharge that oxygen levels were a bit low so they prescribed oxygen for a short period during recovery. Got the oxygen but didn't know if it was helping. You would think they would provide a pulse oximeter. Looked at Amazon and saw this one had a lot of reviews and people were happy. It was delivered within 12 hours and works as described and oxygen level are normal.Only thing I have as a negative is that the instructions give no description of what the measure values mean and what is considered normal. You can find the info online but would be nice to have it in the instructions or a link to a site. PI% is the one measurement that was a bit confusing but seems to give an indication on the reliability of the reading. The higher the percentage the better/"
Works exactly as described.,5,"I wanted to check my blood oxygen level and this product is highly recommended. So, I bought it.We both use it and like the easy to use features.This is a follow up posted a week later. Great customer service. They had offered a 4 port usb hub with the orderand some said they did not get it. I did get it. The company reached out to me to make sure that I received it. I made a mistake in how to redeem and they (they company) emailed me to make sure that I redeemed it.They are very good with product as described. The device is very good and accurate. I like it, some sense ofcontrol with what's going on."
"Great health tool, especially given the current pandemic",5,"My wife loves little medical tools she can use for quick diagnoses. She has the ear thermometer, otoscope, and wants a stethoscope. I thought she might want this pulse oximeter, so I gambled on purchasing this for her. Given the current pandemic we are all suffering through, it seemed like a great little device to keep track of oxygen levels among us and her parents. It's a tiny tool that you simply clip on your finger, and it measures your blood oxygen level and pulse. With school starting back soon and the worry about our son getting sick, this will help us keep an eye on him and his health throughout the school year until this virus passes. It's an affordable tool, which I would recommend you have on hand."
Quality product,5,Checked with other high priced medical equipment.  Very Accurate
"Maybe it won't diagnose Covid, but it gives me peace of mind",5,"I've been rather concerned about catching Covid, since I live alone and have a few preexisting conditions.  Even with reasonable isolation, you still have to be around other people occasionally, unless you have a year's supply of food, gasoline and toilet paper.  I caught what I figured was a cold, but I didn't want to go to the doctor and catch Covid there if I didn't already have it.  Having read that low blood oxygen levels are a sign that you might have Covid that's causing lung issues, I ordered this little gadget.  It's super easy to use, well-designed and easy to read.  It let me know that my O2 levels were fine - maybe I had Covid and maybe I didn't, but I got better and didn't unnecessarily get more exposure running to the doctor.  (Note:  I am obviously not a doctor, so please don't take this as medical advice!)"
Very Compact and Easy to Read--A Nice Comfort,5,"We picked this up after some suspected COVID exposures.  It appears to be rather accurate as best as I can tell (by comparing the measurements to the pulse oximeter I have on my watch).  It's very compact and couldn't be easier to use.  It was nice to have around, now that the whole house has gone through covid.The numbers are a bit small (especially everything other than the pulse ox number), but they are sharp and bright  enough for me to read without my readers, so kudos to them for that!"
Do You Care About Support and Honesty?,5,"I was having a issue with the Oximeter. I contacted their support.I was told that since I was not completely satisfied, they were refunding the cost of the Oximeter to me.I wrote back and all but demanded they NOT refund anything because I was still going to use it.They refunded the charge anyway.I recommend these folks wholeheartedly as being 100% in caring about customer support.You cannot lose working with these folks. If they marketed something else I wanted or needed, I would go to them first.Richard Erickson"
Peace of Mind for COVID-19 Times,5,"After reading about how easily unnoticed breathing problems can creep up on those of us with co-morbidities for COVID-19, I bought 2 of these nifty devices, 1 for me (asthma) and 1 for my older sister (cancer survivor, COPD).  It's super-easy to use--just put in the included batteries, press the on button, and place your fingertip between the cushions to get a quick level.  The oxygen level is the largest number on the display, but I do recommend reading the operation manual, because it explains how it reads your oxygen level so fast and what the additional readings mean.  It turns off about 10 seconds after you remove your finger, so the batteries should last a long time.  My doctor approved when I told him I bought a pulse oximeter because I've been anxious about the virus, and it puts my mind at ease when I feel stressed, or when my chest feels ""tight"".  It also comes with a lanyard and a carry case with a belt loop, but it's small enough to fit in a pocket or small purse.  This is a quality product with an affordable price, so I highly recommend it."
Well Executed Pulse Ox Monitor,5,"I received the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter (Model SM-519BR-BL) today that I bought from Amazon.The oximeter is cleanly designed and well-packaged. It was somewhat more bulky than I expected, but not problematically. Access to the battery compartment was easy, and the included AAA cells powered up the unit. The ergonomics of use are well thought out, and made the unit easy to use before opening the instructions. I love the OLED display clarity and the quickness of displaying information. The size of the display seems small, but it nevertheless is easy to read.Threading the lanyard onto the unit was daunting, but I was able to do it using dental floss as a lead.The oximeter seems well made, and I am optimistic that it will be durable."
Great little tool!,5,"I have asthma and very often have difficulty breathing. I purchased this Oximeter because, between the smoke from wildfires and the Covid restrictions I was unable to get into my doctor's office when needed and could only do video meetings. She recommended I buy an oximeter so she could keep tabs on my breathing and have some data to work with when we met via video. This meter does a great job. when I finally got into the doctor's office, she noted that my meter was almost as accurate as the one in her office.It was affordable and accurate and i would recommend it to anyone!  Thanks for a great product."
"Accurate, easy to read.",5,"When the pandemic started in March, I picked one of these up on the advice of a friend in healthcare. I liked it so much, I bought another one to keep as a back-up for my Mom who has severe asthma. The pulse ox reading matches the reading at my doctor's office so I believe this is an accurate device. Light up display and eady to read. Make sure your finger is pushed all the way into the device, though. With so many people being asked to monitor their symptoms at home these days, this is an important piece of equipment to have."
Top Quality Device,5,"Very nice, like the Oled display.  An added extra on this that is not on many cheaper oximeters is the PI % reading which is the perfusion index, this tells the relative rate of movement of oxygenated blood to the fingertip.  This device can be useful to warn the user of low oxygenation (hypoxia) long before they notice its effects.  Covid 19 researchers have said in studies that hypoxia is present up to a week before symptoms appear and a low reading that is anomalous for that person should immediately alert the user to seek medical attention early in the onset where the condition is testable and successfully treated at a much higher percentage that later in its progression."
Easy and Accurate,5,"I rate the Santa Medical Gurin Pulse Oximeter a 5 out of 5.  I am highly satisfied with the product.  It was easy to get started and use, and yields accurate readings. The display is bright and easy to read, and the instructions are straightforward. In this COVID-19 era, this device could be a lifesaver since you can measure your own blood oxygen level and seek medical attention quickly if necessary.  The device even comes with a lanyard and a cute little protective case!  All in all, this device is wonderful to have on hand!"
I am very happy with this product,5,"I am very pleased with this Pulse Oximeter.  They are IMPOSSIBLE to find in store so I took a chance and ordered on Amazon.  The item came very fast, which both pleased and surprised me.  I like the compact design but it is still very easy to read - even without glasses!Both the oximeter and case are well designed and attractive and super easy to use.  I put the battery furnished in and it began working as soon as I turned it on - it is easy to install the battery and to turn the unit on/off.  I thought it was charming the way the unit reads ""bye bye"" when your turn it off.  Recommend greatly."
"Peace of mind , easy to use",5,This is first time I am getting oximeter due to current covid situation.I was not sure how to use but the product instructions are simple and now its easy for meThis product is now really giving me peace of my mind and at home I can check with easyThe is compact in size and looks very well buildOne pair of cell included and comes with cute little cover bagOverall I can say this is now must have product due to current covid situation so you can monitor your health at home and this product get it job done
The New Canary in The Coal Mine,5,"This device is important to have if you have worries about your suseptibility to lung problems in this age of COVID 19.  This device tells you when your body is losing its ability to process oxygen, a sign that the virus has infected your lungs.  Some people are reportedly showing up at ERs with only 10% of lung function and by then it may be too late.  So if you keep track of your body's circulatory system's ability to intake oxygen with this meter, you can get help sooner and live, maybe.  Easy to read and easy to use and easy to understand.  All good."
Great to have on hand. Never know when you need one. Accurate and good data to know,5,"I purchased this when sick and wasn't sure if it was covid.  Wanted.it just in case.  Came very quick which was great.  Big plus, family member just diagnosed w COPD. They were having a bad episode. Was able to read his oxygen when his breathing was hard, and watched as it climbed slowly from 89 to 97 for 10 minutes. This was helpful not only for us, but.also for informing the doctor on his oxygen and heart rate levels, so they understood what was happening as well."
Love my Oximeter,5,"I got my order yesterday and I immediately fell in love with my Santa Medical Oximeter, small and very practical for people who do not like large purses, it fits anywhere without looking bulky. Very simple to use and handle, made with light but high-quality materials and the screen shows results clear and big enough that I didn't need my glasses to see my results, I was able to reach it from my nightstand in the middle of the night in the dark and I was able to use it without having to put my glasses, it also brings batteries and a lanyard, how awesome is that? I was able to use it right away. The truth is that exceeded my expectations...I carry it wherever I go but I will order another one to leave one in my bedroom and one in my purse."
"East to use, read, and readings seem decent.",5,"Heartbeat rate is quite accurate when compared with my doctors heart monitor. Concerning  oxygen percentage, the oxygen level goes up when at rest and I intentionally breath more, for a minute or two. Conversely, when at rest and I do not breath at all for close to a minute, oxygen percentage starts to go down. So at least the monitor seems to be working with regard to reacting to more or less oxygen being taken into the lungs and ultimately getting into the blood, when the oxygen percentage is finally shown on the monitor."
Pulse Oxi-meter,5,"The Pulse Oximeter has 3 readouts 1) Heart beat rate, 2) blood oxygen & 3) PI%.  The heart beat  readout is very accurate as I tested it by checking my carotid artery.  The blood oxygen readout coincides with the reading from my doctor's oximeter.  The PI% varies considerable and I have no way to verify its accuracy.  It came with batteries."
Very good Oximeter,5,"Thank you for selling such a great product.  I purchased yourSantamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood OxygenSaturation Monitor from Amazon.My whole family has used this device and we are very pleased with howwell it works and how easy it is to operate. The display is very easy toread.  This was a very good purchase and we would all rate it as a 5 of5.  It is very good looking and easy to use. We will be ordering more asgifts for our children and their families."
Great for telehealth appointments,5,"My man sees his doctor often for health issues, and due to the COVID-19 issue, his doctors are doing more telehealth appointments. We got this Pulse Oximeter as his doctor wants pulse ox readings as well as other (blood pressure, etc.). Even though the meter is intended for non-medical use, his doctor has ok'd its use for his telehealth appointments (which are supplemented by in-person appointments as necessary). The case is great to keep the meter safe and clean between uses. We're very happy to have found this device!"
It Helps A Lot,5,"Just what I needed...my doctor told me I needed some type of biofeed information about my body in order to see where I am at and to have a meter to help me achieve maximum or better outcomes on my blood pressure, oxygen in the blood and blood circulation ...this little gadget has assisted with all three. I am doing better! Thank you for this product!"
Takes your heart-rate and blood oxy level,5,"It is accurate:  brought it to the VA for an appointment, and compared it and my kardia reader to the real thing(s).  Nothing really to complain about, but it does battery-drain if you leave it on the finger for a while which I have done a few times.  Recommended."
Accurate readings.,5,"I have several other Santa Medical Pulse Oximeters and find they give consistent readings which also agree with the readings my doctors get in the office. I would rate all as best 5/5 based on my experience over the years. That said, I would like to subtract half a point for this new model, not on results, but on the feel and fit for my hands.  This model is is more squared off and I find it more difficult to push the start button one handed as a result, and I also find that it not as convenient to find the finger hole since there is no shape difference between the hinge and insert ends. So I will rate this model as 4.5/5 based on ease of use for smaller hands."
Works great,5,"Yep, we bought this when covid hit our house like a lot of people probably did.  We definitely were having breathing issues so I ordered this for next-day delivery so we could each monitor ourselves. There were a few times when I thought one of us was going to end up in the hospital but this was great to let us know if our levels were just marginal or something to require more care. This is great to have for peace of mind."
Peace of Mind,5,"This is the first oximeter that I’ve ever purchased.  It works really good giving oxygen levels.  My sister has COPD and congestive heart failure so I needed one to monitor her oxygen levels.  I feel secure knowing that I’m getting a good read.  I also like that it gives the heart beats per minute.  I’m still trying to figure out what the other things mean, but I think her doctors know so any information I can get back to them is very helpful.I love the size and the carrying case to keep it in."
A good working pulse oxy,5,"I had to go several products to find a good working one. Having low blood pressure most devices would not pick up my pulse and would not show any values.This pulse oxy was different.  A nurse used it on me snd it worked great. I got the model name off hers and ordered my own. It easily picks up the pulse and shows the O2 data.It’s a great device, I keep a second one for travel."
An important tool,5,"This item arrived quickly after ordering.  After opening box, it was nice to find the oxidizer just as described.  Came with a carrying pouch with lanyard.  The readings are easy to read and appear to be pretty accurate.  I'm glad we adding this device to our Healthcare kit.  In these times of covid, this device will help us track our oxygen levels at all times to keep us aware of any changes that could signal a problem.  Very happy with this device purchase."
A must have for the medicine cabinet,5,"10 years ago I caught pneumonia and spent a week in intensive care. I wish I had one of these devices back then as it would have enabled me to recognize the pneumonia much earlier and get treatment sooner. Many of the doctors had the portable pulse oximeters, but back then they were expensive and not really consumer devices.Now the devices have become so inexpensive that there is no reason not to have one. Not just for Covid, but for other conditions that can result in pneumonia. It could be the difference between life and death. I almost left it too late to get treatment.I chose the SantaMedical pulse oximeter, for the good reviews, color display, pulse graph and reasonable price. The display is clear and easy to read and its simple to use - just press the button an clip on a finger. It also comes with a handy pouch. Next time I get a fever, I will be sure to have it nearby to make sure it has not progressed to pneumonia."
Great quality oximeter!,5,"I love the quality of the Santa Medical Gurin Oximeter. I originally had ordered another brand Oximeter, and when I received it, the quality was so poor that I sent it back for a refund. I then ordered the Santa Medical Gurin Oximeter, which was exactly what I was looking for! It is sturdy, great quality, and quickly measured my oxygen saturation and PR value. I especially like that it also has a measurement for the perfusion index, which most oximeters do not have. Thank you for a great product!"
Know your numbers in an instant!,5,"This unit is easy to read and has fast results.  The bright blue screen can be read in sun and at night.  I have tried the pic and video but did not work.  I’ve written this review 3 times.  Oh, the battery level is also shown on main screen to give confidence that readings are correct.  I’ve got family members who have issues - this will make a great stocking stuffer that may save a life."
On the mark,5,"Used it when I palpated my pulse at 130 when I had a fever, then compared it with a LifePak15 and it gave similar readings. It seems a bit fragile but otherwise good on scene as another tool in patient assessments."
Works great!,5,"Ordered this little baby online and it works fantastic! It is quick and simple to use, and seems to be extremely accurate as I was able to use it at the same time as using on at my doctors office! and they were exactly the same, in fact this one was a bit quicker then the one my doctor was using. I definitely think it's well worth the money I would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking to monitor their pulse but more importantly their oxygen levels!"
Just the right one.,5,This is the third oxometer I have bought. I have been frustrated by the slow response and what I felt was inaccurate reading. When I went to the pulmonologist they used an oxometer that looked like the ones I had but were faster and more accurate. I finally looked on YouTube for others that were tested. This one was highly recommended by several sites. They were right at least for me!
Matched My Doctor's Pulse Ox,5,"I will rate this unit a 4.5 out of 5.0 not merely for the features(oxidation, heart rate, pulsatile strength, and pulse Plexymorgraph), but also because the Pulse oximeter actually matched the readings of the expensive Pulse Ox at my doctor's office.The only suggestions I can make is that I could not find too many 1.5v rechargable batteries this unit can work with.  Many people, I believe, would like to use rechargeable NiMh batteries with this unit. The other suggestion would be if the unit could make a sound to echo the heart.."
Helpful tool to monitor changes in blood oxygen levels,5,"First, this is not an approved medical device, and should not be used to make medical diagnoses.  I use it to compare relative variations in oxygen saturation levels.  It appears to be reliable, and gives me good feedback, such as the oxygen level increasing when I do deep breathing (deep breathing should increase oxygen levels, and this shows that it does). This device has been helpful to me."
Good for flying,5,"I have this in my flight back to monitor my O2 level on long flights. It's worked great and provides a result in 10-15 seconds. I can not speak the true accuracy, but I would guess it's accurate within 2%. The product game with good instructions, a lanyard, and a small carrying case.I highly recommend this product for other pilots doing mid level cross country flying. It's very easy to use, carry, and a cheap safety measure to protect against hypoxia."
Pulse Oximeter,5,"I am very satisfied with this item.  I have used it on myself and also my chiropractic patients.  It even has a cardiac ejection rate measurement called Profusion Index, along with the standard oxygen concentration measurement plus pulse rate indicator.  There also is a yellow visual marker for pulse rate to help rule out arrythmias.Other similar units may only have 2 of the 3 aforemention: oxygen concentration and pulse measurement, (and no profusion index)."
Simple and Easy,5,"I almost didn’t get this oxymeter because it seemed too good to be true—inexpensive and simple. Happily, I tried it and am very pleased. It’s a solid little meter and comes with a nice protective case for travel. It seems accurate, based on my recent readings in doctors’ offices and hospitals. A friend recommended getting an oxymeter just for peace of mind during this pandemic. All I needed was reassurance that my lungs are working, and this provides it!"
nice product,5,"I love my pulse oximeter.  It is super easy to use and read.  The two tenths that I didn't give it are because I would like to know more about the SpO2 value, the PR valu8e and what the Perfusiuon Index is.  I looked it up on Google, so - no harm, no foul.  But still, I think it would be good to have a couple sentences about those items.  The other .1 that I withheld is because the holes for the lanyard are too small.  I gave up rather than make the holes bigger.Thank you"
Can be worn around your neck in a handy pouch,5,I have stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma. I can't let my oxygen go below 90. This handy little gadget is always with me. I love that it came with batteries. And it's instant accessibility in the neck porch. It's all good.  Woodsborne
Great little monitor for home,5,"This is great! I ordered it and shipped it to my mom who is NOT tech savvy at all because my step dad is having major health issues and doc recommended keeping track of O2 level at home. (I mean, she has trouble with a cell phone and her mind explodes when she even thinks about a smart phone.) She said it was SUPER easy and she was able to get it on and able to use it within just a few mins. So happy."
Excellent product and service!,5,"I recently purchased a Pulse Oximeter from your company through Amazon.com, first, I have to say that I consider the price to be fair and the fact that the batteries are included is greatly appreciated, second,I was given a 3 week delivery estimate, I ordered on May 14th and I was happy and surprised to receive it after only 9 days, on May 23rd.Needless to say that in these very stressful times that we are all living, it is absolutely wonderful to have the tools to monitor your own health and the health of your loved ones, it it simply a piece of mind, and your equipment has given me just that, it works as expected, it is easy to use and read. Thank you!I give this product a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5."
Excellent,5,"I read that these devices are helpful in assessing blood oxygen at home, so we are usIng ours regularly during this time of quarantine.  This model is easy to read and Simple to use.  I assume it is accurate as well.  (no medical training)The seller gave us fast accurate shipping.  All was exactly as we expected."
Best Oxygen reader for the price and quality!,5,"Hello Gurin Management,I will like to said that your product surpassed my expectations, I like the accuracy and the easy way to used it. The price is super good for the top quality of your product. In my opinion your product should be rated five stars because all of the above conditions which are the ones the costumers look for at a time of making a decision. Because is so good I’m likely to recommended to a group of disabled veterans that I have in my organization. If you have some samples to give I can definitely promote your business as well. Please let me know !"
Works Great!,5,This is so easy to use and it seems very accurate.  When my gym required us to wear a mask while exercising inside I decided to buy this to make sure my oxygen level didn't go too low.  I have asthma and breathing while wearing a mask in a high impact class sometimes makes me feel as though I can't get enough air.  I would definitely buy this again.
Great product to have during the pandemic,5,"I just received my Gurin pulse oximeter today.  Tried it right away.  Worked great.  Now I have peace of mind that I can get accurate and quick measurements of my blood oxygen level, pulse and perfusion index.  I feel this tool is more important now that some people are suffering from dangerously low blood oxygen levels without knowing it, due to the coronavirus."
Ease of Use and Accurate,5,"This unit is simple to use, easy to operate and read.  My doctor was onboard with owning one for home use.  It has come in very handy and is yet another tool that we have added to our little home medical kit.  We have used it when monitoring pulse ox during some family covid-19 illnesses.  We were able to provide our doctor with these readings during tele health visits.  Again, so simple, affordable, and nice to have.  Unit seems high quality and accurate.  Would recommend for anyone that needs or wants a pulse ox unit to add to their own medical supplies for home."
Good buy,5,"Pros:Light weightEasy to useComes with carrying case and lanyardOverall seems like good qualityInstant measurementsLove the fact that there is a battery life indicationWishes:Have a section in instructions where it details what acronyms mean...such as SpO2, PR etc.It would also be nice if you include suggesged normal guidlines for measurements...example x - z = good oxygen"
Accurate,5,We bought this because my wife and our daughter both have asthma. It's accurate as it reads the same oxygen level on them as the oximeters the doctors use. Plus the pulse feature is also very accurate. Very easy to use and read.
Reasonable price for peace of mind.,5,"This product is simple to use right out of the box.  Just slip the batteries in, push the on button and put it on your finger.  With this COVID-19 pandemic raging, I got this product to monitor myself for peace of mind.  It is a great product so far (have only had it a couple of days)."
"Very Accurate, Great price",5,"I have checked O2 readings with another oximeter that I have, and the readings were identical.  This is obviously important, since my old meter readings match the ones at my Pulmonologists office.  Additionally, the meter displays the readings quickly, and the screen is clear, bright, and easy to read.  The meter appears to be constructed with quality workmanship and materials.  I am quite happy with this purchase."
Compact amd easy to carry,5,"Love this little pulse-ox. I have used it once and it gave me a good reading, that I would expect (as a retired nurse).  It is easy to use and comes with its own little case and lanyard, for easy carrying around the neck or on a coat hook."
Great for workouts,5,"I bought this pulse oximeter as insurance in case of Covid-19.Since I have it, I have been using it during my daily workouts (mostly Zumba). I enjoy checking my pulse rate when I work out vigorously. The reading pops up in a couple of seconds. It's easy to read.I gave this device 4 stars instead of 5 because the hinge isn't as strong as it could be. If not handled carefully, the jaws can be displaced at a slight angle."
Quick response with bright and easy to read display.,5,The item arrived in a timely manner.  The display is very bright and easy to read.  On several occasions I took multiple readings in quick succession.  The readings displayed rapidly and were very consistent.  I do not hesitate to recommend this item to others.Update:  This is the second of these Oximeters I purchased.  I was so impressed with its performance of  the first one I purchased I gave it to a close friend of mine who recently had bypass heart surgery.  The one he had from Walmart gave very erratic readings and would scare my friend with very low oxygen level readings.  The Santamedical unit assured him his O2 level was perfectly normal.  I can highly recommend these units.
Safety feature,5,This is very easy to use.  The problem with the corona virus is that the loss of oxygen creeps up on you and by the time you realize you are in distress you need massive care. By checking your levels each day you will notice if you levels are going down and can address it before it gets too late.  I am using this also at work.  Just wiping it each time it is used. Very grateful to have something so inexpensive to provide peace of mind.
Very Nice Pulse Oximeter. Great Value,5,The SantaMedical SM-519BR-BL Pulse Oximeter I ordered from Amazon.I found it to be an exceptional device and of great value.I especially like the PI Index feature indicating the Perfusion Index and found it to be a noteworthy function.I also like that the graph is auto calibrating and the readings are accurate.Thank you for a great product.Sincerely;A Happy Customer
Easy to use,5,"This shows pulse as well as oxygen and has a heart beat line as well. Only quibble is the information with it doesn't tell what the PI% means. Have to look that up elsewhere. (Perfusion index: pulse strength at the point it is being taken, .02 (weak) - 20 (strong), in case you wondered. If its weak, try a different finger!"
"Fast, consistent, and easy to use.",5,"We bought an oximeter from Santamedical for two reasons. The first reason is to baseline and monitor my 92 year old mother-in-law who is in congestive heart failure. The second reason reason is to get baselines for ourselves in case we become infected with COVID-19. In that event, we will use it to determine if we need to seek medical attention. We measured multiple baselines for each of us. The measurements were consistent and the device was fast and easy to use."
Good product,5,"I only got this product today, so I can’t speak to durability. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that it came with fresh batteries. It also came with a detailed instruction manual, but it was so easy to use that I didn’t even need to consult the manual. (Of course, as a primary care physician, I have used this type of product before.) It read my pulse and my oxygen level accurately. I am very pleased with my purchase."
FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT,5,"It is easy to use and functional.In reading the instructions, I am to wait 30 seconds for the reading.The only recommendation I would have is that somehow the instrument itself would self time the 30 seconds.I expected it to do that and when it did not occur I, of course, counted out the 30 seconds but that is just a thought to help the consumer.Otherwise the product is working great after many uses."
I love my new pulse ox!,5,"I ordered a home use pulse oximeter because my husband has had some breathing issues for the past few years and, with the current Covid-19 crisis, I want to be able to keep track of his health a bit better.  I am a nurse, so I know the importance of good equipment for assessments, and this little instrument is great.  It is small and compact. easy to use and accurate (yes, I checked it with one at work).  I went to my physician's office the other day and they have the same one in the office.  I highly recommend it."
Simple small and accurate,5,I ordered the  SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter model SM-519BR-BL for myself as well as my 76 year old mother.  I have had respiratory issues for the past 2+ months and have had a lot of shortness of breath.  I questioned my O2 intake and with COVID I have not had  a face to face appointment.  Having the pulse ox available it sets me a ease knowing that I am getting sufficient oxygen.My mother has cardiac issues and uses her Apple watch.  She hs been using my Pulse Ox along with it to verify her oxygen levels and the Gurin has been more accurate than her watch.WIN WIN all around.  I would rate this the highest score of 5.
Easy to use and read,5,"I bought this oximeter to replace an older model that I donated to someone.  It seems to be working well.  As far as accuracy goes, I have not done any controlled testing but it matches my Fitbit and it seems to record my normal Resting HR.  It is very easy to read compared with the previous model which was a little dark and had smaller numbers.  I am overall satisfied with this oximeter.  I would recommend it."
We're Very Happy,5,"As seniors we wanted to know our baseline oxygen levels so if in the future if we became sick we would know if our oxygen levels dropped suddenly.  My husband and I have been testing our levels every day.  We are both getting consistent, although slightly different, results each testing so it appears the levels are fairly accurate.  I am very pleased with how easy this device was to use right out of the package. The results are easy to read and the oximeter says ""bye bye"" when it turns off so you know it is turned off.  I also liked that the device arrived promptly within a few days.  We ordered a different oximeter earlier and it still hadn't arrived after four weeks!  So obviously we canceled that order."
Good product. Everyone needs one.,5,Ordered this pulse oximeter for my daughter who was having some health issues. It was delivered quickly and ehe has told me it is very accurate and easy to use/read her oxygen and pulse levels.  The price was reasonable and everyone should own one of these during these difficult times dealing with the pandemic.
Quick results,5,"This is fast and tells you what you need to know with a single push of a button. Gives you 3 readings in under 5 seconds. Bright lettering is easily read in daylight and there is no annoying beeping. This unit has a clean sleek look and came with a little nylon soft case with velcro to store it in, and I believe there was a lanyard as well. Well worth it for checking oxygen levels and pulse rates."
Check your oxygen level this makes it easy,5,After a family member was diagnosed with heart failure it was storming recommended that they check their blood oxygen levels periodically. This device has made it possible. I have no standard against which I could check it for accuracy but it did seem to agree with the doctors oximeter when at his office.2
Quick and easy to read.,5,"Purchased this after my grandson went to the emergency room and was found to have low blood-oxygen levels. We wanted to make sure that we had one for when they came over to swim. I am also asthmatic (since forever) and thought it would good to have for myself. The device came well-packaged and was easy to use - pop in the batteries, press the button. Compared the readings with my daughter's unit and they read the same so I'm sure it's reasonably accurate. I do like the colors - very easy to read the blue and orange text and graphs - unlike the red used in the Apple Watch Health app."
Peace of mind,5,"Living in the age of Covid-19, is a worrisome time.  Every morning I take my temperature and use my pulse oximeter to make sure I am healthy.  This way if something is off, I will know right away.  It also make me feel good that I am less likely to pass on this disease because of the results I get each morning..  This pulse oximeter is easy to use, quick and accurate.  I highly recommend it."
A good oxygen sensor,5,"Like others, we got this to monitor our oxygen levels in case we get sick.  The oxygen sensor appears to be accurate and registers between 95-99%.  The hear rate monitor coincides with my Fitbit, so I assume it is reasonably accurate as well.  Some have complained about the cheap feel of the hinge.  At first it feels somewhat unstable because the hinge is expandable to fit any size finger.  Of course if you aren't careful with it, I'm sure you could tear it apart.  But it seems reasonably well made and should serve our purposes."
Easy to use; seems accurate,5,"I am, currently, a healthy and fit 60-year-old and want to stay that way. I decided to purchase this oximeter in order to monitor my O2 and pulse and watch for any concerning trends that could alert me to something starting to become a problem. I found the device to be super-simple and easy to use: turn it on and slip your finger inside, with the only thing to be aware of is that you aren't placing it ""upside down"" on your finger. I have not had a way to confirm the accuracy other than that I already know what my resting pulse rate should be and that my O2 is not an issue right now so I expect a high value. Based on this, the device should be accurate enough for home use and to monitor trends. My only complaint is that I have no idea how to attach the lanyard and I wish it had come already attached."
After much research,5,We ordered this after much research and decided this was the best option for usWe ordered this to have the ability to check our stats to assure we are healthy.  It appears to be working correctly and we are healthy and hope to stay that way.
Accurate Oxygen Measurement,5,"I like the ease of use and accuracy of this oximeter. I use it to measure my wife's oxygen levels because she has congestive heart Create ReviewSantamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2) with Case, Batteries and LanyardOverall ratingClearselect to rate item one star.select to rate item two star.select to rate item three star.select to rate item four star.select to rate item five star.Rate featuresAccuracyClearone startwo starsthree starsfour starsfive starsEasy to readClearone startwo starsthree starsfour starsfive starsEasy to useClearone startwo starsthree starsfour starsfive starsAdd a photo or videoShoppers find images and videos more helpful than text alone.Add a headlineAccurate Oxygen MeasurementWrite your reviewfailure and must maintain adequate oxygen . Highly recommended."
Reliable performance at a great price!,5,"I received my new SpO2 sat meter a few days ago and have had the opportunity to use it many times at work.As a Physical Therapist in a hospital setting I use my device all day long.I have had two previous devices that cost me much, much more than this one and yet so far I have found this one just as accurate and user friendly.I particularly like the fact that it has the ability to indicate perfusion level which my more costly ones did not."
"every cns, lpn, or nurse needs",5,"Very easy to use and to read.  I went through a rebate site and found out about this company.  I think the products are wonderful and truly worth the money.  I can be hard on my stuff and hey I have had no problems or complaints.  Anyone that knows me or has looked at other reviews, I am very honest and blunt.  I work hard for my money and I do not want to lead people astray."
Great Pulse-Ox.  Exactly what we were looking for,5,"First--I'm a physician, and I have experience with pulse oximetry.  With this coronavirus pandemic, I did not have much confidence that a small, relatively inexpensive oximeter would have sufficient accuracy to be useful.The Santamedical oximeter proved me wrong.  Its use is intuitive.  It seems to be very accurate.  (I compared it to one used in the OR.)  It seems to be durable.I recommend this product."
Santamedical Pulse Oximeter,5,"I have never owned any other pulse oximeters. This is my first. So I can't really measure the performance of this oximeter to others I've had in the past. But so far, it seems accurate. It's easy to use with a display that provides detailed info. And it comes with a handy carrying pouch. I'm happy with it."
Very good accessory at an affordable price.,5,"I do quite a bit of power walking ( 4 - 6 miles ) at least four times weekly. I decided to get this after my doctor used his in conjunction with his stethoscope during my physical. He explained its purpose. I purchased this Oximeter and took it to him to compare the reading our Oximeters. They both showed the same reading after he explained the functions. I was very satisfied. I'm going to use this before and after my walks, especially with reports that COVID maybe transmitted in open air and my age group. I'll again compare readings at my follow up visit. A 5 Star is possible if accuracy is evident at my next doctor's visit."
Success at last,5,"When our oximeter died last year we replaced it but unfortunately it was cheap and never worked. My own fault. Then the pandemic hit. I was thrilled when I checked with Amazon and saw this one available for perhaps more than I would have considered before but not now. It arrived on time, and immediately started working when the included batteries were inserted. Thank you for your excellent product."
Bright and easy to read,5,The display is large and easy to read in normal room light or in the dark.  The price was a pleasant surprise too!  Some time ago I bought an oximeter with a plain LED display ( no light)  and payed more for it.  This is the same kind they use in the doctors office.  MUCH better than my old one.
Easy to use.... hope it never reads low blood ox on me,5,"I purchased this after a friend of my cousin had low blood ox readings.... and her children took her into Emergency. Yes, she tested positive for Covid and underwent treatment.  She went in *before* her symptoms became severe being warned by the low blood ox.This product had the most reviews, so obviously, the most sales.  I felt safe buying it for my home."
Same brand as my Cardiologist uses,5,"I bought another Santa Medical oximeter for a friend and this one for me.  This is the brand my Cardioligist uses so I trust them both (both models read the same)So far, so good!Some unhappy users complained about the “loose” hinge. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY, dummies!  That expanding hinge is design to open up to let you push your finger in all of the way!"
Peace of mind,5,"Bought this while battling Covid caused pneumonia, at home. My oxygen was 84 when I went to the doctor. He suggested ER. I didn't want to do that, so I bought this and kept an eye on my oxygen. It never went lower, and as it rose I was a lot les concerned! And so was the wife. This is worth having for sure."
Exactly what I wanted,5,"I ordered this oximeter because it wasn't full of all sorts of things either I wouldn't know its purpose/interpretation and would be very easy to use. It didn't hurt that it was also on sale. Unless one needs to know more than their Sp02, pulse rate and perfusion index, this device should more than suffice and won't break the bank."
Perfect for my needs.,5,"I was looking for a inexpensive, non-medical grade oximeter to check my oxygen level while exercising and also to insure I have an early warning should I acquire Covid.  This product works perfectly for my needs and the numbers closely match those taken recently on a medical checkup."
Great product,5,"I have been using this product to keep checking our numbers. I concentrate on the oxygen levels and it seems to be very consistent.  Hopefully, we will never need it detect lower levels, but I wish we had this in March when we were fighting covid- like illness but could not get tested.  I'm not in the medical field to confirm its accuracy, but it's been very consistent for us."
Reliable,5,"I use it to check in each day with my health care provider.  It appears to be accurate.  It is well-made, light, and easy to use."
Very good product,5,"Over the years, I've used many pulse oximeters. While most worked I found that some were not reliable with some breaking after 3 months of use. I was looking to replace one for my mother who is 88 years old but didn't want to pay a fortune. When I came across this one and saw the price and features, I had to buy it. I must say it works great and am very happy with the product."
QUALITY AND RELIABILITY,5,"First: I am not a professional reviewer.The weight, the looks and the price will tell you that this Santa Medica OxiMeter is not a toy or cheapy Mickey Mouse device.  You feel it very sturdy. Pilots and mountain climber use it.I have tried it with me, the wife and children several times a day and always the readings are consistent which is very important.  In seconds you can have the level of oxygen in your blood and heart rate that are vital health information especially in these times of pandemic.  Buy it."
A good tool to fight the pandemic,5,"My Oximeter arrived the day after I place my order, just as promised. I'm using it to monitor my blood oxygen level as a low level can be an early indicator of Covid19. Just one more way to gain peace of mind. If it drops below 90 I will call my doctor and self isolate until I can be tested. I have several people in my family that are high-risk and the last thing I'd ever want to do is make them sick."
"Easy, convenient, accurate",5,"After reviewing all the Oximeters available online I purchased Pulse Oximeter Fingertip, Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor (SpO2) with Pulse Rate Measurements and Pulse Bar Graph, Portable Digital Reading OLED Display by Gurin Products. I am very happy with the oximeter as it is easy to use and read the results. Highly recommend this product that comes with batteries and carrying case."
Nice Product!,5,I bought this to have a way to check Oxygen saturation levels in my body. It's on lists for recommended items to have in the house in case a family member becomes infected with the coronavirus and becomes sick. If the infection moves into the lungs and impairs oxygenation of the blood stream this can be a warning that its time to seek medical help. Having recently been hospitalized and in ICU I'm familiar with my oxygen levels. This Oximeter is right on target. It has the added  benefit of showing pulse rate as a bar graph and in numerical form. It feels well made and is very easy to use. The read out is small but very clear. I would recommend it!
Great Oximeter!,5,"Easy to use, easy to understand, great value!"
Checked it with my interist,5,"Took my oximeter to a recent visit with my internist and it was insync with hers.  Now if I report any variations or anomalies at future office visits, they will be taken seriously.  I have relatively low BP and my fingers are often cold, so it is reassuring to know if that has any affect on my O2 reading.  Easy to use. Everybody who sees it wants to try it."
Complete data,5,I have on several palsy oximeter‘s and this one appears to be of the higher quality of those I have used. I really appreciate the accuracy measurement on it as well as the oxygen and pulse capabilities. The case it comes in is very durable and will be great when we travel.
"Just what I needed, my Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter Monitor",5,"I got interested in this device as I realize the importance of monitoring my oxygen levels after going to the doctor and found out I was wheezing and my oxygen level was low and especially with the covid-19 pandemic, its very imperative to monitor one's oxygen level. Very easy to use and the carry case its just ideal, its size allows it fit easily in any handbag pouch with ease. The reading is instant. Very pleased with this item!!"
"Quick Delivery, Works Great, Peace of Mind, Definately Recommend",5,Arrived on time! It's a sturdy little monitor and it comes with a case. I tried it out right a way and it was easy to use and worked great. With Covid-19 I feel so much better having this monitor so I can check my oxygen level. I like that it is small and with the little case for it I know I won't have to worry about damaging it if I put it in my purse or travel bag. I highly recommend this
Great oxygen meter,5,Does exactly what it should.  The only thing I didn’t like was to secure the lanyard was impossible I have never been able to do it and had several neighbors try also.  I would suggest they put it on while manufacturing and then if you don’t want it on just cut it off
Use if you can't get a covid test.,5,Since CoVid 19 tests are very hard to get in most areas and might take a week to get results this is the best I could do.  So I use my thermometer three or four times a week and now the O2 monitor also that amount.  This might not be as good as the test but temperature and oxygen levels are early indicators along with other symptoms are good indicators.
Simple and accurate.,5,"Bought one for myself, but now feel perfectly comfortable buying one for an elderly family member with COPD to track and monitor O2 and hopefully encourage breathing exercises and healthier lifestyle. Simple to use and read straight out of the box.  Handy to store in its case or hung by the strap. Fast, accurate measurements and no difficulties using or reading it."
Bright Colorful Display,5,"Nice. Has a bright, colorful display. Gives perfusion index in addition to pulse rate, Oxygen saturation and Plethysmogram wave. Many units don't measure perfusion index or show wave pattern. Only takes a few seconds for reading to be displayed. As for accuracy, matches readings of my doctor's unit.Was hard to attach lanyard, but got it done."
"Nice compact Oximeter, sleek black, bright display, comes with case and batteries...5 stars!",5,"I ordered two SantaMedicine Oximeters and am very pleased with them.  The sleek black devices have a brightly colored digital display.  Very easy to read.  They come with a nice case and lanyard, plus batteries.  I compared readings several times with both devices and they almost matched every time.  Reassuring.  The nicely packaged devices come with a lanyard, sturdy case and a comprehensive instruction leaflet.  Truly a 5 star product!"
An accurate pulse oximeter,5,"Most of these devices are pretty easy to read/use - what matters most is they are accurate. I bought this brand because a similar one was recommended by a doctor for its accuracy. I double-checked this with a pulse oximeter one of my doctors has and it's accurate. Good price and fast shipping too, when a while back these were running $100 with a 4 week wait."
Accurate and a great value.,5,"Wife has afib and needs an oximeter to keep track of her pulse rate and oxygen level.  Last meter she had confirmed she was having an episode and allowed us to get to the hospital before the attack was full blown. After 2 years that meter finally quit.  This oximeter is sturdier than her previous one, easy to read and accurate (compared it using an Apple watch). The other reviewers were correct with their 5 star assessments and it is well worth the price for peace of mind, especially in these times. Very satisfied."
Big Improvement Over Prior Device,5,"I have used the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter for a couple of days, and it provides more information, is more accurate, and much faster displaying results than my prior device.With my prior device, it would consistently read a few points less of O2 than my MD's office.  And it was very slow to calculate results.I also checked my pulse manually and compared to the results of this new device...results were identical."
Great for the price,5,Reads very fast. Pretty accurate overall. Other Sp02 take a while to show data this one seems to take under 5 to 6 seconds on average. Will be very useful in the field. This should not be bought to self diagnosed yourself at home. Sp02 numbers can very easily be manipulated. Overall a great product.
You get an idea of how your system is working,5,"I liked the easiness to use and the simple reading. I can not yet rate the accuracy until I have a doctor appointment where I can take my pulsometer and compare the reading to that at the doctor's office. I do expect some slight variation though, I think there may be variation even if using two separate units of the same manufacturing. But I hope variation would be minimal"
"Accurate, Inexpensive and should be in your home!",5,I wanted a second pulse ox to have on hand. We use ours regularly before Covid due to other issues of rapid heartbeat.This pulse ox works great. Readings seem to be accurate and it is very simple to use.
Easy to read!,5,The color scheme on the display makes everything very easy to read.  Its a pretty simple product but a must have to monitor your wellness levels.  I am very pleased with the ease to use this product and its small enough to keep in your travel toiletry bag.
"This oximeter device seems well made, easy to use and well priced",5,"So far I really like this little device. The pulse measured on the oximeter is consistent with what my Apple watch records. I know this is not medical grade, but it gives me some peace of mind during the current pandemic. My wife and I have been using it to establish baseline blood oxygen readings as we are currently healthy. I looked at different oximeters from other companies and reviews of this device were convincingly positive. The device seems well made and so far I am happy with my purchase."
Accurate and durable,5,I was hospitalized with covid. Prior to going home compared this pulse ox and facelake pulse ox to hospital equipment. Both would give accurate readings but Santamedical was faster to get an accurate result and you can see the a waveform that you can check for accuracy vs your pulse which is nice. I’ve had this in my pocket for two weeks so is durable and it even made it through my washer and dryer and still works.
EASY TO READ,5,"I JUST received this, so this review is not about longevity, which is yet to be determined.I purchased it by studying product reviews and ease of reading, with multiple colored LED display.As far as accuracy??  I can't tell you that.  I would need several units to compare it to, viewing consistency from unit to unit (different brands) to come to some logical conclusion.  Is it displaying what reasonably makes sense?  Yes.  And, yes, it is definitely easy to use."
Works,5,"I honestly bought this so I could give my Dr. the readings, that stuff is way above my head and he did make me do it 3 times to get an accurate reading which was not a big deal because it only takes a second to do it. I'm sure that if I had read directions I could have figured the numbers out myself but I didn't have to so I didn't."
Great PulseOx,5,"This PulseOx arrived quickly and in good condition. I'm an EMT and purchased this for my personal use. I love this model. It's easy to use, easy to read, shuts itself off and seems to be accurate within 1% on both me and my son. It also comes in a great carrying case."
Great price,5,"Works perfectly and came with a nice pouch to keep lint out. Never buy these at retail stores because they will charge you twice as much. As a nurse,  I go through a lot of these. I always purchase from Amazon. Haven’t been disappointed by one yet."
A well engineered product that works well,5,"We bought this SantaMedical Pulse Oximeter on recommendation of our chiropractor, who had researched the models on the market.  The ordering process was simple, and the reviews convinced me that this was likely to be a good product.  It arrived quickly and I set it up and both of us used it – it is very easy and clear to use, and I found it quite accurate and helpful.  We are using it regularly to insure our health is strong.  The fact that it reads 3 different factors (Oxygenation, pulse and perfusion)  is helpful, and we are now familiar with the meanings and normal ranges for each.  I rate it 5 of 5 (excellent quality), and we would buy it again if we needed another one."
Good product at a good price,5,"Although I've read varying opinions on this, some medical authorities think that blood / oxygen level can be at least as accurate a predictor of Covid-19 as body temperature. Regardless, it's fairly inexpensive, quite intuitive and easy to use, so it may be a worthy adjunct to the medical thermometer these days."
This is easy to use and easy to read.,5,"I purchased two of these pulse oximeters—one for me and one for my daughter—so we can monitor our oxygen levels during this scary time of COVID-19. I'm using it every day to establish a baseline so I will know if my blood oxygen ever starts to decrease. So far it seems to be consistent and it is lightweight and comfortable to use. The readings appear within a few seconds. My only complaint is that I cannot get the lanyard through the tiny hole provided, but luckily I don't need a lanyard as I do not plan to carry this around."
Handy dandy gizmo,5,"Crazy to think that only hospitals and clinics used to have these, and now you can get your very own for not too much money!  We bought it just to have, and in case anyone of us gets Covid.  It seems very easy to use.  You put it on and give it a second, and wallah!  It gives oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and shows a little image of  your heart functioning, and there is one more number, but I am not sure what that one tells us.  It's a good thing to have!"
Great Product!,5,"Had this item recommended to me and I am glad I got it.  I needed an easy to use, accurate device to give me my heart rate so I could tell if I was exercising in the right zone.  I actually found from the initial reading I was working harder than I needed and now I pace myself much better."
Works just like the Doctor's,5,So easy to use.  Insert the batteries (included) and it's ready to go.  Bright display that can be read easily in little to no light! Matched the doctor's reading exactly.  I'm very pleased with the instrument and the neat carrying case.
VERY CONVENIENT,5,"I just received this item.  It is compact, came with the batteries, a lanyard and a nice case for it.  I have already used it today and it appears to be very accurate and in sync with another oximeter on my watch. Very happy with this item."
Great tool!,5,"Works great, but dark nail polish can give inaccurate results. I haven’t had my nails done this entire pandemic and I hate cutting them myself because then they peel. So, after I couldn’t get an accurate reading on this, I cut my nails down & repainted a lighter color, now it works fine.Stay safe everyone!"
Accurate compared with Apple watch and bicep cuff blood pressure machine,5,"Picked this up with the whole COVID stuff causing O2 abnormalities. Came in handy when I was hit with a COVID scare. Compared this with Apple watch and a blood pressure machine I have. Heart Rate is spot on with both of them. 1-3bpm variation due to timing of each machine, but that's expected."
Blood Oxygen Reader A Must,5,"My husband tested positive for Covid and had a very low oxygen level which can produce clots and be fatal.  He uses this great little reader each day to keep things in check.  After a certain age or when fighting a bronchial cough, this reader will monitor levels and help the user make a decision if they should seek medical attention."
great  brand,5,"we already had an older version but got a second one for hikes, family members... This is less expensive than the first, but works just as well...solid signal, pulse accurate (which means it is getting a good read), and sats are making sense and consistent"
Don't be without one Covid-19 is real!,5,"Very easy to use right out of the box. Read instructions, put in batteries, used it on my wife and myself. We purchased this because a friend that is hospitalized with Covid-19 and one of the first symptoms was low blood oxygen. We decided this would be a good investment in today's environment."
Great product,5,"I got the dreaded Rona and I'm a transplant patient so I wanted to monitor my O2 levels. This works perfectly. Yes the hinge seems weak but I believe it's because it's meant to give room for bigger fingers, so the two pieces can expand farther apart. Works fast, easy to read."
During this Covid Pandemic this is necessary!,5,"My Oximeter arrived in good condition. It included the unit,carrying pouch,AAA batteries, lanyard & instructions. It was easy to set up and results are clearly displayed. My Son successfully came thru Covid and will need to check his oxygen level for some time. Having one at home is SO much easier than running to the Doctor!"
"Very nice device, but should include a ""normal"" chart",5,"The oximeter itself is terrific – an amazing little bit of technology that's very simple to use. Unfortunately the instructions do not include information on ""normal"" ranges for the readings. I had to track those down online. It'd be best if they were shown either on the device itself or perhaps on a card included with the device."
Quality product that is easy to use.,5,Easy to use and of good quality. Easy to set up by installing the batteries. It takes a few second to register initial values once finger is placed in the device. Keep finger in device against your leg or other solid object if your hands shake as that will throw off the readings. I like the plethysmogram which shows pulse rate. It comes with a nice case and a lanyard. The lanyard hole in the device was too small for me to use so I hooked the lanyard on the case and that worked well.
Works as advertised,5,This item works as advertised. I can't say whether it's accurate or not as I have nothing to compare it too. It is repeatable and the readings do vary over measurement time so I'm assuming it's taking accurate readings. If the readings are critical I would suggest you have your doctor check against theirs.
Simple and portable,5,"We got this to keep track of oxygen levels for our family. It was easy enough for us all to figure out and use quickly. It seems sturdy and is easy to read. The levels seem consistent with how we are feeling day to day. It is a great product for the price in my opinion, I am very happy with my purchase."
Solid product,5,Loving this product so far. As an Nordic/Alpine Ski patroller we are using these a lot more in our field. Mostly back in the Ski patrol building but we also Mountain bike patrol at our mountain. This product allows me to put this on patient and continuing my survey and not have to wait to get the vital vitals before moving on to continue my help.
Nice product,5,"I bought this pulse oximeter to keep on hand because with COVID hanging around, you just never know and my forever motto is 'better safe than sorry', lol. Others reviews were great on it and the product seems accurate. It is easy to read and easy to use and I love the little carrying bag it came in."
This has been a life saver,5,I got this for a loved one in their 80's with congestive heart failure and it's an absolute life saver to see how their oxygen levels are doing when they do any sort of physical activity which lowers their oxygen level. Amazing technology for the price.
Great product!,5,I bought one to keep an eye on my oxygen levels since the COVID outbreak. This product is easy to use and accurate. Note to ladies who wear very dark fingernail polish: This may give a false reading so you may have to repeat it a couple of times to get an accurate reading.
This seems to work very well,5,"I purchased this to monitor my oxygen levels, especially at night. I can see the numerals for heartbeat and O2 well, as they are fairly large and brightly lit. It helps that I can leave it on my finger for awhile to track moment-by-moment changes in oxygen levels, and also “see” my heartbeat to help monitor arrhythmias.The unit seems well made, a nice small size which is easy to use and not cumbersome, and the battery is keeping its charge nicely. I’m very pleased with this so far!"
An Excellent instrument,5,"Great to find one of these things that works well ....so far. We work in remote areas of Honduras, and nothing is worse than to have your o2 sat give out on you in the middle of nowhere. I have been disappointed with others so that I will be giving this one a good test. For now, it is working very well."
Good enough for a professional,5,"As an ER nurse, I was being very picky about my pulse ox. I tried a few cheaper brands which were horrible. This one is of great quality and provides a clear pleth waveform. It's a good deal for the price. Highly recommend."
...just like the one in my Dr.'s office,5,"Received fast.  Works as expected;  just like the one in my Dr.'s office.  I ordered the Pulse Oximeter to monitor my blood oxygen level.  They say, if you have coronavirus, you should monitor your oxygen level, while in quarantine.  Actually, it's good to have if you have any breathing problems or need to monitor  your pulse."
Easy to read,5,This is very easy to use and read. Great for a spot check during a work out or labor intense chores. Also keeps me informed about what the pollens and pollutants are doing to my lungs. (The Saharan dust is the worst.) I gave it a 4 for accuracy because I just don't know. It does seem internally consistent.
Finally a good Oxygen monitor,5,"I tried a few Oxygen finger monitors.  Most don't work properly, they are too flimsy,  or simply give wrong readings.  This is one is a keeper.  It's well constructed and provides consistent readings.  The case is a the icing of the cake..  Recommended!"
Reliable and Accurate,5,"I like the accuracy - measured against another pulse oximeter I've had for many years, the readings are identical. The oximeter reliably and quickly provides accurate blood oxygen level readouts. So I HIGHLY recommend this oximeter."
Pleased to have this unit.,5,Simple to operate.  Nice design.  I am not a professional but I do not take the first reading but let it remain in place for it to land on a number that appears to be stable and what is intended.  At first mine reads high then drops back.  My mission is to find out if my problem is blood pressure or oxygen.
GREAT OXIMETER - matches up with hospital machine readings,5,I purchased this after an ER visit and they asked if I had one to monitor my blood oxygen levels.I ended up hospitalized a week later and this oximeter matched up with the hospital equipment with readings.
Must Have Medical Equipment,5,"I just got this out and set it up to measure O2 saturation if needed.  It appears to be as good as others I have used at work in the past.  I love the way it looks, the cord to carry it with and the case it comes with.  I tested it on myself and my husband and it is totally accurate.  It's nice to have one at home and to feel prepared.  I love it!"
Security Blanket,5,"Love it! Easy to use. I use it all the time whenever I have a panic attack and feel like I can’t breathe. The machine shows me I am breathing fine and the lack of oxygen is in my head. If you are OCD and have panic attacks, this may ease your mind."
Know my Numbers,5,"I have chronic asthmatic bronchitis brought on by allergies.  I bought the meter to help determine when I need a breathing treatment and when I need to remove my mask during the COVID pandemic.  It works very quickly and seems accurate.  And it uses standard batteries, so it's easy to maintain."
Accurate and reliable measurement,5,Rating: Five (5)I recently ordered the SantaMedical Gurin Pulse Oximeter Kit. What a great choice I made of all the similar finger models available through Amazon.The device works perfectly straight out of the box. Delivery was as promised and the price was amazing. An outstanding measurement device.Thank you!
Good Unit at a good price,5,"I did not order this for COVID-19. I mainly use it when working out/ running. Seems to be accurate as far as oxygen measurement is concerned. Not too sure as far as heart rate is concerned. My resting heart rate seem a little high on this unit. It is about 10 units higher than what my doctor always shows. I also took my pulse and it is lower than what the unit shows. Still, I think this is a good unit overall and a good value for the price."
An important device to have in my medicine cabinet,5,I occasionally suffer from allergy-induced asthma at certain times of the year. The oximeter helped me keep track of my oxygen levels so I didn't overuse or underuse my inhaler. Glad I only have to use it  in the spring. Thank you for an easy to use and accurate meter. It arrive on time and in perfect condition.
Great product!,5,"I ordered the oximeter on Sunday, it arrived Monday!  The directions were easy to follow for the set up and the read out on the oximeter is clear and bright.  I’ve already recommended it to two friends;  one has received hers already and is equally as happy with it.  It’s indispensable for maintaining good health!"
Easy to use and accurate,5,"Product arrived quickly. It reads oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The display is clear and well lit. It's  activated by a small button on the lid and deactivates when not in use -- reads ""bye"" as it shuts down."
Nice little gizmo,5,"Well, my doctor was hitting on me (that's my story, and sticking to it...) and told me that I had A Cute Bronchitis. Wow. Anyway, a friend of mine suggested using the gizmo to make sure that I wasn't becoming a zombie. Seemed to work pretty good, and I only get a craving for brains if I drink tequila..."
Perfect for my needs,5,With so much COVID going around I thought it would be a good idea to be able to check my or family and friends O2 level should they become distressed.  This product is so easy to use and read.  Absolutely worth the price.
Great affordable pulse oximeter!,5,"So far, I'm very satisfied with the quality of this pulse oximeter.Pros:1. Easy to read vibrant display2. Quick, accurate readings3. Nice build quality4. Included storage pouchCons:Nothing so far"
Great to have on hand,5,"I purchased this oximeter when my husband and I had COVID a couple months ago. Thankfully, our health didn't decline to the point where we needed to closely monitor our oxygen levels, but I was happy to have this on hand in case it was needed."
Accurate and good value,5,"Bought this when I had Covid early this year.  I was lucky enough to not have breathing problems, but I just wanted to keep an eye on my O2 levels anyway.  Very easy to use and quite accurate (same results as at my doctors office)."
Works great,5,"Seems to work appropriately. I like that it has a graph so you can tell if it’s reading correctly. If you read the simple instructions, it’s pretty simple. Make sure you’re sitting down to take your reading. Recommend."
Works Great!,5,This worked perfect for me right out of the box. The other one I have will not work for me when I am having too mant skipped beats or in Atrial Fibrillation. SO I am very happy with this! Fast shipping and a great price.
Oxygen / yep that’s what we needed to know for the DOC,5,"Kiddo had a bad run in with COVID first & second time. Second go around DOC wanted to know Oxygen levels this little guy worked like a (lucky charm) ok bad choice of words.BUT it worked , even worked on the toes when kiddo was sleeping.  This thing has no issues 10/10 buying again if needed."
Reliable product - Great Seller Fast Shipping,5,We ordered two of the SantaMedical Pulse Oximeters for our family. They arrived yesterday and were able to get them started immediately with no effort. It seems to be a good quality and came together easily.We purchased your particular product based on reviews that stated it was a high quality product as compared to other pulse oximeters. Based on our limited time with it all is as we had hoped. We definitely recommend this product.
Helpful,5,"We are very satisfied with our purchase on the SantaMedical Oximeter. My husband and I tried it right away but had to get online to see what normal/average numbers are and what the abbreviated indicators actually meant.  No problem, the process was easy.We give it a 5.  Well built and seems accurate.  Really like the little carrying case and lanyard."
Could not be easier to use...and accurate!,5,"Like many others here, I purchased this oximeter to measure me and my wife's oxygen levels during COVID. Setup is as simple as opening the back, inserting 2 AAA batteries, close back and that's it. Stick your finger, press your button, and 5 seconds later, it has your readings. Readings are accurate as well (give or take 2-3 BPMs as compared to my FitBit, though not sure which is more accurate). Item comes with a small storing bag and a lanyard."
This is a great oximeter!,5,"I bought this for my wife who has COPD to monitor her SpO2 levels.  We rate this product as 5 Stars because of it’s high quality easy to read OLED display, Great value and ease of use. We have another Oximeter with an old style led display but my wife likes the Santa Medical much better. Thanks for an outstanding product."
Great product!,5,"I ordered this oximeter just  a week ago. Got it today and was greatly satisfied. It came with a detailed set of instructions, a carrying case and a lanyard. The device is of great quality and registers the O2 and Pulse rate on a very easy to read screen. Came with 2 AAA batteries and I was immediately in business. Very satisfied with this product and recommend it."
Life Saving equipment,5,I bought this product when I was admonished by my little sister and a friend to check my husband‘s oxygen levels because he grew very sick after a positive Covid test. This tiny device alerted us to the fact that he was experiencing hypoxemia. Thank God for this device! I took my husband to the ER where he was hospitalized for three weeks in the ICU. He was critically ill with Covid pneumonia. He needed oxygen immediately and he still on 24 hours seven days a week oxygen at home. Thank you for this!
It's easy to use and easy to read,5,The display is crisp and clear and the progressive reading of the heart beat is a nice addition.  The quick speed at which it turns off when no longer being used is a great way to prolong battery longevity.  It was a good purchase.
Accurate!,5,I bought this for my niece who is sick with Covid. It’s been very handy because she’s had to go to the ER several times for low oxygen! She said the readings this gave were the same as the hospital showed.
Easy to read,5,This little gadget is great! It comes with a lanyard and a little pouch to protect it when You put it on your purse. You can read your numbers easily and accurately . It has automatic shut off so no batter is wasted.  It’s light so you can put it in your pocket . Easy to clean and sanitize so it’s ready for the next use.
Great display,5,I recently listened to a pulmonologist who had fought COVID-19 in NYC and what he said about the virus prompted me to buy this product.  I like that the display is large enough to see that I don't need to track down a pair of readers.  Nice lanyard comes with it and batteries as well...that is a Gonga!
Simple to Use Device,5,"This device is simple to use and works quickly. There was a prompt to rate accuracy but I cannot speak to that as I have not compared the results I get from this device with those from a calibrated device, I am just trusting that this is producing accurate (or near accurate) readings."
Great Addition,5,"This is a very easy to use, easy to read instrument.  Push the button, put your finger in the oximeter, boom...results in a few seconds. The display is easy to read, the information is very useful.  I can't attest to accuracy, as I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do know that if you don't have your finger positioned correctly, it gives vastly different results...so it's reading ""something"".  In today's increasingly technical medical world, this instrument is a must have for the new ""medicine cabinet""."
Excellent purchase,5,"This item is fast, accurate and easy to use. It gives me great peace of mind when I am going about my day and my breathing becomes labored. In just seconds I can see my actual oxygen saturation. I should have bought this long ago."
Excellent value ...,5,"Well-made product, works great.  I have no way today of judging accuracy, but will take along to my next doc appointment and compare with theirs.  I'm a bit of a geek, so the fact that it has an OLED display is a nice little techie bonus!"
It is consistently accurate,5,"I have Asthma, COPD, Afib and Coronary Artery Disease therefore I depend daily on the Oximeter.  It is extremely important that it is consistently accurate.  There are some new features on this Oximeter and I am delighted.Thank you for making such a great product."
Accurate results at a good price point,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I liked it it has a waveform so I can see the blood pulsating through my finger as it picks up a reading. I haven’t compared it to other oximeters but it seems to work quite well."
Accuracy,5,"It is very convenient and easy to operate. Press one bottom and it will gives you three important data: your heart rate, oxygen saturation and perfusion index. It can?t go easier than that. Not many pulse oximeter on market comes with perfusion index indicator and this product does. So this is already a plus. During this Covid pandemic time, I think it is very imperative to have a fast and accurate oximeter on hand in case of any friends or family members experience any sign and symptoms of shortness of breath. You will already have the vital signs such as oxygen saturation number and heart rate on hand when you seeking medical attention. Thanks."
"So far, so good",5,"I got the oximeter to measure my oxygen level because of the Covid-19 concerns. So far it has worked well, and has a nice multicolored information display window.  It came with a nice little black carrying case and neck lanyard/strap. The instructions are extensive and I am still reading/learning more about the unit."
Easy to Use and Gives a Little Peace of Mind for Monitoring for COVID-19 Symptoms,5,"I purchased a pulse oximeter on June 27, 2020 from Santa Medical and it arrived at my house in only 3 days.  It looked nice right out of the box and even came with a case and strap you can attach, as well as the required batteries.  The instructions were easy to understand and very complete.  I inserted the batteries and it came on in a matter of seconds with easy to read numbers for my oxygen level and pulse.  This little device was reasonably priced and will give me piece of mind that I will have some important data to monitor symptoms for me and my family in this time of uncertainty with the COVID-19 cases."
Well worth the money,5,"Product is well worth the money.  I'm not sure what feature it would have that I would want or need - wait, yes, guessing lottery numbers!  Just kidding.Its as accurate as the one my doctor uses, we did them side by side.  Auto power off, will stay on as long as I wear it etc.  If Dollar v Value is key to you this is worth it."
This thing is VERY impressive!!,5,"Right out of the box, this meter works and looks great! Comes with a really nice ballistic nylon case. (One of) the things that's really nice is it takes simple, AAA batteries. No hunting around for some obscure ""button battery."" It works fast, has a very readable screen, and the shipping was ultra-fast!!"
Works well,5,This product arrived in a timely manor and works well. I've owned it for a few months now and can say that it will probably give me future trouble free operation. I would recommend it to somebody looking to purchase one of these.
Easy to use and accurate,5,Rating of SantaMedican GurinI would rate this product as a 5.  I checked the results from this product with my doctor’s office and have gotten the same results.  The results I get are consistent with my iPhone application related to the pulse so I feel very confident in the use and accuracy of this product.  The small carrying case for it works very well and it's well made.  It makes it easy to take to the gym to check on oxidation levels.  I recommend this a friend and they also bought it and like it very much also.
Easy to use,5,"The packaging of my Pulse Oximeter was nice and easy to open the battery slot. The LED panel is very clear to read. Overall, I found the quality product with reasonable price. Lanyard installation was easy and in addition convenient to carry around while going out for walk 👍 Carrying case is convenient as well with the product"
Fast and accurate,5,"I have recently purchased the model SM-519BR-BL from Amazon, I think the  product is easy to use and offers a more accurate  reading than other manufacturers.Electronics and graphics are good, screen doesn’t turn according to position. I would like that it included a silicon protection like others in case it falls off. It isn’t clear if the cord must be tied directly to the device or is just for the case, because it was hard to nail it into the device. It uses two AAA batteries (included) which is good.I think the product is good enough and it deserves a 5."
Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter,5,"Slip it on the fingertip, press button, then receive accurate results in 5 - 7 seconds.  I verified pulse rate against my blood pressure monitor and the santamedical was within one or two beats every time."
Great Value,5,This is a great product for the price and is efficient and accurate.  I compared it to the reading from one used at a doctor's office within minutes and they were the same. Considering local stores wanted 39.00 for one (different brand) I was very pleased with the purchase and recommend it if you are in need of one.
Appears to function very well,5,"The device appears to work well and is probably accurate - I don't have another certified device to compare the results (it's an engineer thing).  The multi-color display is very nice.  The device is different than many similar devices in that it also indicates the ""PI%"".  When I initially read up on it and purchased it, I was mildly interested in the PI% data; however, when the device came, there wasn't any explanation for what the PI% really means nor its significance to the user.  My purchase may have come with an older version of the limited instructions - from before the addition of the PI% feature."
Love it,5,"Got it due to this whole COVID thing, actually got COVID and it was really helpful to measure my O2 quickly when I would panic and think I was out of breath, turns out I was not, just panicking, but the device is quick and easy to use."
Works Well,5,"Reads color of blood in skin.  If Push finger against wall skin turns white, no blood. Same here. DO NOT PRESS, Insert finger GENTLY, hold finger Up in air, DO NOT TOUCH WITH OTHER HAND. HAND MUST BE WARM WARM. WORKS WELL."
Worth it,5,This was well worth the money for the reduction in anxiety. I work as a nurse and having the ability to check vitals on my loved ones at home is totally worth it. This seems accurate and I like that it has a waveform to show if the reading is a true reading. We gauge accuracy by the waveform at work so having a waveform to check is really nice. Easy to clean and has a case which is nice. Especially with COVID this has been great to have as a check on how loved ones are doing without having to go to a clinic.
Ease of use,5,"Works well. Both the heart rate and O2 rates are accurate on this unit, had the opportunity to check it and compare with another unit. Another tool in the toolbox during this pandemic"
Reading out doors,5,"I bought this item because it can be read outdoors. I had one that had a red led display and I could not read it outdoors. I believe the item works well. I checked it against other pulse oximeters. If you turn it on and get a reading of 99, wait several seconds and you will get the correct reading."
"Easy to read , stays put on your finger",5,"Very easy to read... I don't really know how you could check the accuracy ? You would need to have hospital quality equipment to verify.. it's very easy to attach to your finger .. ( it doesn't slide around, or slip off your finger's , like some meters do .."
Very easy to use and quick to provide results,5,"I find that the display is vivid, easy to read in all light conditions.  Like all oximeters, this unit is easy to use and responds with results very quickly.  The power button is located on top and makes the unit come to life immediately.  Once remove your finger the system shuts down right away, preserving batter power.  Batteries (2 AA) were included in the package.  Also provided is a smart case which keeps it protected when not in use.  I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone."
It works!,5,"The meter was bought to track oxygen levels incase of contracting covid 19.  It was reassuring.  Your oxygen levels can drop without you realizing it if you have the virus. Its also a cheap way of detecting it in my opinion. By the way, my dentist also used a similar devise to take my oxygen levels and a thermometer to see whether it was safe to do a dental procedure on me."
Easy to use.  Nice large numbers to read.,5,"I ordered this to see what our normal O2 stats are with COVID-19, it gives us a clear baseline.  I love how easy it is to use and reading the numbers with out my glasses is wonderful. MeAnd it's shuts its self down after putting it down and not touching it, so that saves the batteries."
Highly recommend,5,I purchased this about a month ago and use it several times a day.I have to keep track of both of my oxygen and my heart rate. This works very well for me.I have had several and the Santa Medical is my favorite.  I highly recommend this one as my readings compare well with my Doctor's.
Nice device for home use,5,I got this in the mail and several days later my father-in-law was short of breath.  His pulse oximeter reading was 86 which is low.  We took him to the doctor and this device reading was similar to the reading at the doctor's office.  Very simple to use.  Would definitely buy again.
just a good thing to know,5,i have copd and constantly moniter my oxy level i am new to my oxygen machine so there  is a learning curve .....two timesmi thought i was tired and checkedmmy oxy level and just went on my machine to get level up felt better
Works well for a great price,5,"This oximeter is just what we needed. It works well, seems to be accurate, comes with a case and lanyard for when you aren't using it, and is clear and easy to read. I don't think you can go wrong for the price. It provided peace of mind for COVID monitoring and I'd recommend it to anyone."
Great Device,5,"I recently purchased  my SantaMedical Pulse OximeterSM-519BR-BL. I am very impressed with the display, bright and easy to read. My doctor insisted on testing the device and it exactly matched the results of her far more expensive unit. Absolutely satisfied."
Works well,5,"I use this product to routinely monitor my blood oxygen level. It is also handy to check my pulse rate. I have been using this product for over 4 months now and have not had any problems. Have not had to replace the battery yet. Occasionally I get what I think are erroneous readings likely because my finger was not exactly positioned in the right spot. It is sensitive to proper finger location. However, it is very easy to take another reading if something does not look right."
Easy to use,5,"I purchased this upon recommendation by epidemiologist to use in case we contract the Covid virus. If O2 levels dip below 93 percent , hospitalization is recommended. The device is easy to use and , per my RN wife , accurate. Comes with a protective case which is nice."
Peace of mind,5,"For $20 bucks this little guy provides peace of mind, for any and all folks who are facing Covid-19 issues & I think for those who suffer any respiratory health problems. Arrives with 1st set of batteries, large bright display & super easy to use."
Piece of mind during the VID,5,Was easy to use and came with batteries.  Only thing I had to look up is what numbers I needed to keep an eye on (top number needs to stay higher than 92) and what the bottom percentage meant.
Easy and Accurate,5,I have been having respiratory problems after having Covid and ended up in the hospital. This little thing lets me quickly check my oxygen and heart rate while giving me peace of mind.
It has everything I wanted in an Oximeter,5,"I saw this one and thought it looked pretty, was priced right and it also had great reviews.  It is very handy and I have used it several times since I received it last week.  It has a good, easy to read display. It came in a case with batteries, lanyard and operating instructions just as pictured.  I am very pleased with my choice and recommend it."
Easily obtains a reading.,5,"Our other O2 sensor was highly reviewed like this one, but was not as good at picking up a pulse and a reading. I especially like the continuous graph for the pulse strength readout."
"In the new world of covid, this is like having a thermometer in the medicine cabinet",5,"Easy to use, and a great value. Never really thought about a device like this until covid, and then finding them was scarce. Picked up 2 heading into flu season. Starts up quick, seems to be accurate, however, I have no way of comparing it to anything."
Oximeter,5,The oximeter works perfectly. It seems to be totally accurate. I used it on the fingers and the toes. I think it was a very good deal for the price. I would highly recommend the oximeter for anyone who wants to keep tabs on their oxygen level and pulse rate.
Easy to use,5,I liked this Santamedical pulse oximeter...easy to use and it does not fall off my finger....Only thing I was disappointed in was the cheap satchel to keep it in and the flimsy ribbon attached to device.....that could certainly use some cosmetic improvements.
Precise when compared to hospital medical equipment.,5,The display shows all you need for O2 and more. It even tracks that it's placed correctly.
Great product,5,"I would highly recommend this product. It is easy to use and very helpful. Your blood oxygen level should be above 90, which is something the directions don't say. It also gives your BPM which is very nice. It is good quality,  very easy to read, and easy to use."
Monitor Health at Home,5,"Product received was as described, huge bonus it included 2 AAA batteries AND a case. Love that it measures oxygen saturation, PI% and heart rate (BPM).  Came with detailed instructions and a lanyard.  Turns off automatically so I don't have to think about it. Recommended!"
Excellent instrument to help give my physician daily info on my health.,5,"I used this odometer to confirm pulse rates from my blood pressure cuff, and to give my PCP a listing of important healthcare markers before discussing with her.  She found the daily reporting with easy to use instruments like this odometer to be helpful."
Very helpful when sick,5,"I like that this has the heartbeat pattern and a perfusion index so that I could see if it was getting a good reading.  I got it in case someone in the family got COVID-19.  When I was sick with COVID-19 a couple of months later, it was reassuring for me to see that my body was maintaining adequate oxygen saturation as part of monitoring my own symptoms while isolating and treating myself at home."
Excellent oximeter,5,Well constructed.  Fast readout.  Compared it to the one used n the hospital and the readings were the same for both blood pressure and oxygen levels.  I like that it shuts off after 10 sec to save battery lifeI would recommend the oximeter
"Works great - easy to use, clear digital readout",5,"The Oximeter works great. Easy to use, clear digital printout. Function and quality of the Oximeter are great.The directions for attaching the lanyard show that it is supposed to feed through the little holes in the Oximeter. I spent about 45 minutes trying to feed the little string through those holes. I tried all 4 holes, but it just doesn't work. The carrying case is nice, though, and there is a place there to easily attach the lanyard, so that's what I settled for. If the lanyard really is supposed to attach to the device, that part of the design doesn't work!"
Works great!  Great resource to have around the home.,5,"Can use it on the whole family, from toddlers to adults.  We found it works great on toes too.  It's good to know oxygen levels during illnesses or any other events that may affect the lungs or heart.  Excellent resource to have around the home."
very cool and useful device,5,"this little thing is awesome.  For less than twenty bucks, to get this biofeedback, that is not only useful for diagnosing issues, but also just plain good to know about the way your body is working is just cool.  I check my stats multiple times a day just to make sure everything is working correctly.  It only takes like 5 -10 seconds - why not?!"
Feeling a Little More Secure,5,My partner has developed some minor heart issues. She checked the Pulse Oximeter when she went to her doctor and found it almost Spot On. Now we have a Great Way to assist us at home for both of us.
Easy to use,5,"I decided to buy this because my son got COVID-19 and was having shortness of breath, so I wanted to be able to monitor that. I was very happy with this item. It arrived quickly, was easy to use and seems to be accurate. It comes with a little nylon case and lanyard so it can be protected, and easy to carry."
Easy to use and gives objective data,5,"I just bought another one of these, for my neighbor. She's had a portion of her lung removed and gets very short of breath. With this she will have solid data for her doctor."
Ideal for checking heartbeat during an aerobic walk.,5,"The Pulse Oximeter was recommended by my older brother. I carry it with me when I walk the neighborhood. But today, I was at home getting ready to go to the bank when I used the Pulse Oximeter, I saw the irregular display of my heartbeat. I verified it by using my blood pressure monitor and it indicated an irregular heartbeat over several measurements. I drove to my medical plan offices and got an EKG. I am glad that I had the Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter and will carry it with me all the time."
"Good price, quality and accurate instrument, and fast delivery.",5,"Even though it says it is not intended for medical use, I am a nurse and it works wonderfully, and I like seeing the plethysmograph wave form, and the perfusion index. My own primary care provider told me to get a pulse ox for my asthma, and allergy problems with oak pollen, to do occasional oxygen sat checks. This fits my needs! When I do physical exertion, it helps to know my sats do not go to low. Thanks!"
Definitely worth the purchase.,5,Works great me and my wife had Covid-19 so I ordered this to watch our oxygen and it saved my wife life as her oxygen dropped to 86% and I was able to get her to the hospital in time
Best in class,5,"The Santamedical Dual Color Oximeter is a great product. The product is very accurate and screen is easy to read. It has been a great way to blodd oxygen levels in the age of covid 19, especially when you have allergies, if nothing else, for peace of mind. I would buy again in a heartbeat..."
Very Good Pulse Oximeter,5,After getting  a new smartphone I was disappointed that the pulse and oximeter function had been removed from Samsung smartphones.  I purchased this product and am very happy with it.  The product is very easy to use and the display is very clear and easy to read.
Great product,5,"I remember when we had an oximeter for one of my kids, insurance paid for it, but it was several thousand dollars to purchase.  This product is perfect for times when knowing your oxygen levels may be important.  I can't attest to the accuracy of the oxygen level, but it seems to be correct.  I know that the pulse measure is correct, I can compare that to another product and I know my base heart rate.  It's small, comes with a carrying case and is easy to juse on anyone."
Pretty accurate,5,I’ve had couple of these and this one by far is the best. Easy to read & pretty accurate. Only complaint is mine was missing the battery cover but I just put tape over it.
Very useful in COVID 19 times.,5,I’m a frontline healthcare worker working in a nursing home. I have purchased this Oxymeter before and i trust it to give me accurate readings when assessing my patients. I have recommended this product to my family members and also for personal use. Highly recommended. Trusted and proven product.
Absolutely would recommend.,5,This is our 2nd one we have bought. Our 1st we gave to my father when he had covid and it was fantastic. My husband is a PE survivor and we keep track of his O2 levels. It is extremely accurate.
O2 sensor is imperative to have if dealing with patients that have pneumonia or severe Covid-19.,5,"My husband had Covid-19 and dealt with low O2 levels so I relied on this one and one I already had. It was because I was watching his O2 levels that I made a decision to bring him into ER for a third time. They had dipped down to 85 and lower. He was admitted for 2 days and released with oxygen for two weeks, which helped him overcome the problems he was having. Used the O2 sensors dozens of times for 4 weeks."
Easy to read Display,5,"After my son got out of the hospital with covid-19 we needed one of these to monitor his o2. Arrived quickly and able to use it soon as he was home. Quick read, easy bright display."
Fast and Accurate,5,"It only takes a few seconds to get readings.  The numbers are easy to read in daylight or in darkness.  The pulse rate is accurate; I have no way to check the accuracy of the oxygen level.  The number does rise slightly when I do deep breathing, and then goes back down after a while to the original number, so it appears to be working.  I am very happy with this device."
Important little device during the pandemic,5,"Very easy to use, accurate. I own a Fitbit which does not to SPO2 on-demand, only overnight so I wanted to have a device to allow me to get that number on demand during a bad bout with Covid"
Great for checking O2 levels while wearing a mask,5,I order the Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter in order to monitor my oxygen levels while wearing a facial mask. I found the unit to be accurate and easy to use. I would recommend the product to anyone who is interested in keeping tabs on their health overall. 5 out of 5 stars.
Great and reliable product,5,Received this product a few days ago.  So far everything seems to be working correctly.I found peace of mind during this covid crisis to know that I can always check my oxygen level to make sure it is in the range it should be.  Would recommend this highly!
Easy to use oximeter,5,"This little oximeter is so easy to use I appreciate being able to have tools like this at home for use during virtual medical appointments. Thanks, Amazon, for your great selection and quick service with prime!"
Must haves,5,"As requested I am sending you feedback on the pulse oximeter.It is nice and small.  Very light weight.  Convenient to take on my runs and bicycle rides because of those two previous features. When I am not exercising it sits in my medicine cabinet for me to use whenever its needed. In this time of the pandemic, I find it comforting to know there is an alternative to finding out my health status other than a thermometer.Thank you so very much,Walter at 70"
Easy to use,5,"My sister and I are both over 65 and live together. She is a therapist and still sees clients in her practice. We were looking for ways to monitor our health, and besides a blood pressure monitor, we were advised by our physician to get an oximeter to make sure we know how we are really doing in this time of Covid-19.  This is easy to use and not a clumsy or over technical device and we are pleased with it."
Works well,5,"I tested this as follows. Exhaling all air from my lungs and then holding my breath until I need to breathe: reads at 90 then slowly climbs to 99 as I start breathing. Start with full breath at 99 and then abruptly hold my breath for as long as I can: plunges from 99 to 95 to 90, then slowly climbs to 99 when I breath. And slowly exhaling: slowly goes from 99 one to two points at a time until 90, then slowly climbs to 99 when I breath."
Good Quality/Decent Price,5,"I just received the Santa Medical pulse oximeter. It seems to work fine and I would give a 5 rating. Replacing the battery cover was somewhat of a challenge but eventually I managed. I’ve had other oximeters but this is the first one  with a perfusion indicator in the display. Even with going on the web I could not learn what's the perfusion Numbers meant and what was normal. It would’ve been helpful to have this explanation in your operations manual. All in all, I’m fully satisfied with this device. Seems good quality at a reasonable price."
Oximeter,5,"Very simple to read, with numbers clearly visible. The only reason I didn't rate accuracy 5 stars is that there is no possible way I can verify any medical devices accuracy. I can say that compared to my other devices it appears to be quite accurate with similar readings. I got this in response to this COVID-19 outbreak."
Easy to use and reasonably priced,5,I have no point of reference for the O2 reading to determine accuracy. However the heart rate reading is within a couple of points of the blood pressure machine I have
Great way to get accurate blood oxygen Levels - Perfect for those with asthma,5,"This oximeter is a great tool to have in the house, especially during these COVID times, and is about as dummy-proof as you can get. All you do is remove the back cover and pop in the 2 included AAA batteries, press the button to turn it on, and stick your finger in (hey...get your mind out of the gutter!). My son is asthmatic and he can go from bad to worse pretty quickly so this has been helpful in making sure his blood oxygen level is good, usually above 94%. The reading is accurate and this brand is known as one of the best out there in terms of oximeters."
Easy to use,5,"My Pulse Oximeter arrived promptly.  I was very well wrapped and was in excellent condition.  It is very easy to use.  And, it is important to me as I have some underlying health conditions and my doctor thought it was important for me to have a pulse oximeter to monitor the saturation of oxygen in my red blood cells."
Great accuracy,5,To have one of these while trying to recover at home from the Covid-19 made a big difference.  I could check my oxygen levels at anytime and my pulse.  This is a must have in every home.  Good price and great accuracy.
Small print but effective,5,"The ease of getting ready to use and the actual use was very easy.  Without an accurate standard by which to judge one can only hope the readings are correct.  However, the numbers do seem to be what one would expect.  It's rather handy for quick checking of oxygen and pulse.  I like it."
useful information,5,I would rate the product as a 5.....quality and function as expected..The grahics for the pulse are great.....the colors and intensity of the screen are very good........The screen letters are a little small/fine to read for an older person..................I did choose to buy the slightly better one of these (this one) to ensure good technology and reliability.............It's great to observe/record these readings as a tracking for good health...........it makes you feel good to know everything is OK............I also gained by learning more about what the data is measuring and understanding that....
Better than advertised...,5,"I just received this Pulse Oximeter and it is exactly as advertised. Seems accurate as compared to Apple Watch, easy to change batteries (which were included), and comes with a wrist strap and a storage bag.  Instructions were complete (and not really needed).  The one thing not mentioned is the unit will work fine on rechargeable AAA batteries with their lower voltage."
Perfect! Works great!,5,Bought this for my Dad when he got covid. I don't live nearby so I needed to be able to check on him. He sent me frequent pictures of his O2 sats to keep me updated!
Excellent instrument,5,"I previously ordered a pulse oximeter from another manufacturer and the readings it gave were so inconsistent I sent it back for a refund. I ordered the Gurin pulse oximeter from Amazon in May of 2020 and it is an excellent instrument. I rate it 5 stars. It gives consistent readings every time and they are consistent with the readings I get at my pulmonologist's office. It worked so well that my friend ordered one for herself.I.N. Sporn, M.D."
Accurate and easy to use,5,"This seems to be accurate and easy to use. Seems very sturdy, numbers are large and easy to see. Very useful item to have during the COVID pandemic. Highly recommend. Also, great customer service. Item came BEFORE the due date. Extremely impressed. Thank you."
Reads oxygen level like the pros!,5,Got hit with Covid and this instrument was instrumental in helping monitoring not only mine oxygen but my mother in laws oxygen level. My mother in law got her own and we both use it regularly on our road to recovery. As an asthmatic I find it very helpful managing my oxygen level also.
"Good, simple pulse oxygen meter",5,Very nice product that does just what it claims. We measured this and another brand against the pulse ox meter at a clinic and this one was spot on. Great little product to have around in this time of worry.
good item,5,"This seems to do the job just fine - did use a YouTube video to help clarify some of the aspects of it - figured things out and keep it on hand to use when needed,"
Excellent,5,! I’ve heard it’s important to have a pulse oximeter  especially during this time of Covid. This is an excellent one! I am very pleased with how easy it is to use and read.  I will be buying a second one for my parents!
Top notch pulse oximeter,5,"This pulse ox lives up to its description.  After fast arrival, it was put to immediate use and delivered quick results of my husband’s oxygen and heart rate.  The one we had recently bought gave wrong information, so we were very happy to find this oximeter giving consistently correct readings. We are quite pleased with this product and highly recommend it!"
"Small, portable, easy to use and easy to read.",5,"So far, I have been very impressed with this pulse-ox unit.  It’s small and portable, yet easy to read, and present good data in just a few seconds.  It’s difficult to rate on durability after having it only a few days, but so far it seems like it will last."
"Easy to use, results vary",5,"This should be used for a relative indication of oxigenation.  Your results will vary finger to finger so use the same finger for consistent comparisons.Your nail should also be clean and free of  contamination,waxes and polish."
Accurate and affordable device,5,"The oximeter I received was accurate, easy to use, and affordable. I found the manual to explain almost everything well with the one exception being PI%, however that has been explained on the amazon page and information is readily available via a quick google search. The carrying case and lanyard are a nice touch. It could be a little tricky to get the lanyard through the hole without any tools, but if you have access to something like a toothpick or even a mechanical pencil you should not run into any problems."
Timely purchase,5,"The Santamedical dual color OLED pulse oximeter is comfortable, quick, and easy to read. Very reasonably priced. We purchased this because my wife was recently exposed to COVID-19 and has symptoms of bronchitis. We wanted to monitor blood oxygen. It has been very reassuring to take the guess work out of it. THANK YOU!"
Check your levels!,5,"So a funny thing happened, I got covid. Wife was being pain about making sure I was going to live, so she bought this item to check my levels every few hours. I made it though it and this little thing worked like a charm. Jokes on her, she caught it and made it."
Another Peace of Mind Daily Check,5,My husband and I are checking our temperatures daily.  Our daughter suggested we get this device to provide us with additional daily health checkup for peace of mind.  All we can do for ourselves during this pandemic and even after is very reassuring.
It’s very lightweight,5,Looks nice but very lightI expected it to be heavier. I haven’t washed it yet. I hope it will hold up. If it doesn’t I’ll return because they said it was washable.
Easy to use and accurate.,5,"As some others have said, it’s a good idea to check your blood oxygen level in these COVID times.  The reading was the  same as the one at my doctor’s office.  It’s very easy to use, and batteries were included."
This is the Oximeter you want!,5,I received this two days ago and it is so easy to use and gives peace of mind when wanting to know you heart rate and oxygen levels.  I recommend this to everyone.
Great purchase,5,Bought this for my adult daughter that has severe asthma. With pandemic going on I needed peace of mind of her breathing.  Wish I had purchased it years ago!
Nice pulseox meter,5,Seems like a good product. I had a different one from another company which did not have a replaceable battery. This one takes 2 AAA batteries which I like.
Great buy!,5,"I've purchased 3 of these for family members, and all are quick, accurate, and easy to use.  I appreciate the lanyard and protective case.  I use this in my morning screening routine, along with using a forehead thermometer.  Worth the money for peace of mind!"
Easy to use oximeter for a good price,5,"This oximeter is easy to use and read with big numbers for the important stuff. I don't have anything to compare it to so I can't necessarily speak to it's accuracy, but the results don't fluctuate too much so I assume it's doing a good job. The hinge feels a little loose so I would be worried about using it while moving around (I doubt it would survive a fall), but it works well for what I need it for. Considering how much some other oximeters cost, this is a good deal."
"Excellent, Accurate Pulse Oximeter",5,"After having to return one for inaccuracy, I was so pleased that the Santa Medical Oximeter worked correctly the minute I turned it on.  And it has a battery reading as well.  Very satisfied with this product!"
"exactly what I need, suggested by ER... TO PREVENT PANIC...",5,"I tested my husband, right on, I am impressed, that it showed mydetails to positions. lack of, oxygen, do to spinal cord injury at neck and chest. showed positional , control of breathing, immediate response plus pulse rate...GREAT BUY"
A good value for the price,5,"I ordered a SantaMedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter and found the product was very easy to learn to setup and use and will be using it to monitor my own health and that of my family.  The quality of the product is very high with an easy to read display and it seems well-constructed so I expect it to last a long time.  As far as I can tell comparing it to other oximeters we have access to, it is also very accurate."
Accurate and easy to use,5,"Oximeter is very easy to use and provides good accuracy ( checked with the different instrument).Everything is good except the poorly written manual, which can confuse a person not familiar with the blood oxygen saturation measurements."
Excelente producto,5,"Excelente producto, muy fácil de usar se apaga al quitarlo del dedo a los 10 segundos , por lo que ahorra batería , casi tan preciso como el del hospital"
"Accurate, immediate readings.",5,"I work in a medical field and understand the importance of knowing your numbers; blood pressure, pulse ox and all others...This device is small, easy to store, easy to carry  with you, has it’s own purse for storage. The reading is immediate and accurate. I’m satisfied with the purchase."
"Excellent oximeter, well worth the money!",5,I really like this oximeter.  It is very accurate and easy to read.  I also like the auto-turn off function after you use it.  I would recommend this oximeter to anyone trying to keep track of their oxygen level and heart rate.
Great Value,5,This device arrived when promised and works great.  It helps me monitor my heart rate and also my oxygen saturation levels in the blood....a good thing.
Exactly what I was wanting,5,"This blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor Sp02 is the exact model I was wanting, easy to read and easy to use. It is important that I have a meter so I can keep track of both my heart rate and my oxygen level. Tank you for the well made product."
that this is very accurate,5,i like this machine pretty well.could be larger for digital read out.our pa wanted us to have one on hand.this was a 5 star rated and costs$18.95 regular $38.00
Everything I needed,5,"I gave my old one to my parents when they got COVID, and this was a great replacement, really helped my wife track her symptoms when she came down with it."
Easy to use and just what I wanted.,5,This product is easy to use and comes in a nice little case that can fit in a medium size pocket or pocketbook.  The filly is bright and very readable.
Easy,5,This is my second one. It’s very important to have an oximeter during this Covid times I priced them at my local pharmacy & they were twice the price!!
Peace of mind,5,"I sent this to a niece who, along with her husband and teenage son, was sick with Covid 19 and made an emergency trip to urgent care.  After hearing this, I immediately ordered this monitor for her.  It arrived the very next day.  She called me to express thanks for the peace of mind it gave her."
Easy to read,5,"I looked at reviews for different oximeters and chose this one. As far as accuracy, the bpm is pretty accurate. The pi and the oxygen level readings will be used for trending. It is easy to use and read. The build quality is good enough for me."
"Good product, simple and very easy to use!",5,"Recently I bought this product.Its a great pulse oximeter.The builds of the product feels very premium.This meter is very easy to use and excellent for accurate readings.You just need to put your finger in the slot and push the button,it’s automatically takes the reading for you.Overall, I am happy with the product and would definitely recommend that every household have one."
easy to use... and a potential Covid-19 diagnosis aid,5,Fast and easy... monitors saturation level quickly.Could also... help you determine urgency for pneumonia symptoms while on the phone with your medical doctor. Not a true medical instrument but a good indicator.
A real life saver!,5,"Came down with the dreaded Covid virus and it was recommended to check oxygen and pulse. Worked well even though I have dip powder nail polish on my nails. This was easy to use and as accurate as hospital monitors. When it showed my oxygen levels at 88, we went right to the hospital. Good thing we had this great gadget!"
Brought this to my Primary,5,At first I thought it may be off BUT brought it to my primary doctors and tested it against their machine several times and it’s exact. I was impressed.
Easy to read and good quality,5,Arrived very fast and worked well right out of the box. It comes with batteries :)This this a very important device to have at  home to check your oxygen level. Very easy to read it. Also shows heart rate/pulsing .
Good product  easy to use higher quality than most others battery cover slips off frequently,5,Liked the good  advanced quality  disliked the battery cover not  being secure lost one of these because the battery cover became missing and the pulse ox was not useable
Quality product that is easy to use.,5,This pulse oximeter for the fingertip appears to be well made. Its worked fine and the display was easy to read. The instructions were very thorough but easy to read and understand. Overall performance appears to be satisfactory. I am satisfied with the unit.

Good Inexpensive Unit,5,"My Dr. recommended I get one of these after quad bypass surgery.  Saw this inexpensive one and bought it.  Reads exactly as his, so very pleased."
Good Product,5,"We bought the product to see if wearing masks made a difference in our oxygen levels. The product seems to work quite well and my oxygen level has remained high. It doesn't explain why I feel winded if I wear the mask for any amount of time - it could be the CO2, which isn't measured on any devise like this."
"Great value, great product",5,Brought to Dr appt to check accuracy and it was right on target with their oximeter. It takes about 30 seconds to get the final reading and it has a case with a string to wear around your neck while you're active. Great product

Great product,5,I have been waiting since February for the pharmacy to get any in. They still have not. This one is easy to use. Inexpensive. With only 1 1/2 lung use because of cancer it is reassuring to be able to monitor it myself.
"Functioned out of the box, perfectly, very easy to use",5,"I liked that this product was everything the description said it was.  It works great and is exactly in line with my sports watch readings.  Simple to use, and the display is very readable.  I would recommend this to anyone."
Good value,5,The SM-519BR-BL pulse oximeter has all the features I was looking for at a reasonable price. The PI% helps confirm I have the meter positioned properly - not that it is that difficult in the first place. It is fun to watch the scrolling graph. The display is bright and easy to read.
Excellent add to my home medical equipment,5,The display of the Santamedical Dual Color OLED Pulse Oximeter is clear and well organized. The LED is bright and easy to see. Results are quick. I like it and recommend it as a first choice. It seems to be as dependable and durable as any I have seen in medical offices. The cost was awesome.

Immediate results and so easy to use,5,"I am very pleased with this product.  I bought this pulse oximeter  so I could check my oxygen level since you can test positive for Covid without any debilitating symptoms.  Several friends, including one doctor also recommended this item. I am very pleased that the results are immediate and easy to read.  I was also glad to receive the 2 batteries in the box, so I didn't have to search for batteries to make it work."

Very handy, comes with a storage bag. I recommend it to anyone who needs it."
Monitor your O2 during the mask mania,5,"Very nice look, bright colorful display, fast results. Very convenient storage bag. Comes with the 2 AAA batteries you need to get up and going immediately. Handy lanyard that can unbuckled to remove. Very reasonable price. I will be using it to check my O2 levels while wearing a mask all day."
Includes 4 data points instead of 2,5,"A friend in the medical field recommend I have one on hand during Covid. This product included the PI% which many don't as  well as the graphing function.  Great functionality, especially for the price."
Possibly saved my hubby’s life.,5,Hubby had Covid. Was feeling bad but not short of breath. Checked his pulse ox and it was 85% and heart rate was 120. Took him to urgent care and then ER. Had/has pneumonia. Hospital now at home on O2. We still use it often every day.
Accurate and easy to use,5,"This was accurate, easy to read and use.  With COVID oxygen levels are very important and this measures that easily and quickly.  It put my mind at ease.  I am glad I bought it!"
"Great device, great quality",5,"This device is very impressive for it's size and price.  My only complaint, is that the type size of the directions is way, way too small.  Otherwise, GREAT!!Thanks,Scott"
Accuracy,5,THe unit was very easy to read and answered all my questions.The only thing that mystifies me is how to thread the lanyard into the thread holes on the back of the unit.Other than that I am very happy with the unit
Peace of Mind,5,"This Pulse Oximeter arrived a couple of days ago & we are so excited aboutusing it.  Several people in our community have recently been hospitalizedwith COVID-19, the main reason being that their oxygen levels wereextremely low.  We wanted to have a way to monitor that if necessary.  Sofar we have tested it on everyone in our family and the device is workinggreat.  I'm thankful for the carrying case to help keep track of it sincethe device is small and portable, and could easily be misplaced."
what a wondferful device,5,I use this at home and when traveling. It quickly takes my pulse and blood O2 level. If only blood pressure machines were this small.
easy to read,5,I have nothing to compare the readings with but it is the trend of the numbers not the individual number that matters.I purchased this one over the others because of the write ups. Works for me
Great buy!!!!!,5,I bought this because my husband had covid and I needed to make sure his oxygen level did not get too low.  It was very accurate and precise.
Excellent quality and price,5,"In this age of virtual doctor visits, this is an extremely valuable tool to have. I have asthma and my doctor is always concerned with my pulse oxygen levels. I find this a quick and easy to read meter. Excellent quality for the price."
Nice Product,5,"This item works well and is wasy to read. And it comes with batteries, which is nice. Plus it was delivered the same day. Amazing."
It was a great buy for my elderly parents.,5,Purchase this item for my elderly parents. They didn’t not have any issues understanding how it worked. They seem to really like it.
We love this!,5,"We purchased your Santa Medical Pulse Oximeter SM-519BR-BL, and arrived when it should have.  We rate it a five (the best of a 1 to 5 scale).  It is better than the one at the doctor's office.  Along with telling the oxygen saturation and the pulse, we like that it has a battery display, which we have never seen before.  The plethysmogram is an interesting feature.  The automatic turn off saves on battery life.  We like the lanyard with the easily detachable clip.  The carrying case makes it easy to find with out other instruments.  We can't think of any improvements."
Peace of mind!!,5,"I am an ER nurse and I made this purchase shortly after contracting COVID and pneumonia, then my husband also got COVID. It gave me peace of mind having the ability to monitor our oxygen saturation from home as we recovered!"
These are amazing!,5,I love these bulbs. Just leave your switch on and they come on when it starts to get dark and go off the next morning. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy again. Plus the yellow is so much better to deter bugs.
Pleased with purchase,5,"Very pleased with my purchase, super helpful! I’m thankful to have found a good one that seems to be good accuracy. I appreciate that very much especially with all that’s going on in the world. These are nice to have on hand."

Just what was needed,5,"My first purchase of an pulse oximeter so really cannot compare to any others quality or expectations.  However, this item is what I needed to maintain my health needs."
Working well,5,"I purchased this to replace another slightly cheaper monitor.  Seems that it is more consistent with what the doctor's office reported.  Only real problem was that the holes are too small to install the lanyard.  I don't need it, but if you do you might want to try another model."
Easy to use,5,"Easy to use, compact and light. Easy read out. Good price also."

Great little device,5,Easy to use but sometimes you need to adjust it on the finger or change fingers to get a good reading. The reading is never that far off but trying it a couple of times or trying more than one finger seems best.

I really like the pulse tracking graphic.  Nice touch.  Really a great meter, and the price was, I think, the lowest of the bunch on Amazon.  My mother-in-law needed hers replaced, but at this price, we got one for our home, too.  Thanks !!!"
Great item!,5,"This  device is a quality item. It’s easy to read and use, although one not experienced in connecting lanyards, I had trouble connecting the lanyard “strap” to the oximeter (to hang around my neck when walking etc.,) the company was very helpful in showing me and most people should not have any trouble.."

Worth it!,5,We ordered the Santamedical oxygen reader to test my husbands levels. He had a stroke and has to wear a mask at work and so we wanted to make sure he was getting enough oxygen.We are very pleased with the device and like that it also tells the pulse rate as well. It is small enough to fit into lunch bags and purses to always carry with us. We would highly recommend this product.
What is your oxygen level?,5,"Not sure how to tell how accurate it is, but it has been telling me my oxygen level is usually over 95%, so I think it is ok. I find it easy to use and read. It arrived quickly and batteries were included."

In my opinion, the pulse oximeter because I can read the blood oxigen saturation accurate."
